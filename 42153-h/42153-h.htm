<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p>It was supper time at the Rectory, and the
Rector had not come in. There were two
conflicting elements at the Rectory, the Rector's
disregard of details and his sister's sense
of their importance. There was only one will,
however, and that was his sister's. So the
meals were always punctual, and the Rector
was always late; a fact that by its very recurrence
would have long ceased to be
important, had not Miss Esther loved to
accentuate it by a certain formula of complaint
that varied as little as the offence itself.
This evening, however, he was later than
usual; and Miss Esther did not attempt to
conceal her impatience as she glanced from
the old clock in the corner down to the fire-place,
where another familiar grievance awaited
her.</p>

<p>"Katharine, how often have I told you not
to lie on the rug like a great boy?" she said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
querulously, in the tone of one who has not
the courage or the character to be really angry.
She added immediately, "I want you to ring
the bell for the soup."</p>

<p>The girl on the floor rolled over lazily, and
shut her book with a bang.</p>

<p>"Daddy hasn't come in yet," she said,
sitting up on her heels and shaking the hair
out of her eyes. A latent spirit of revolt was
in her tone, although she spoke half absently,
as if her thoughts were still with her book.
Miss Esther tapped her foot on the ground
impatiently.</p>

<p>"It is exactly two minutes to eight," she
said sharply. "I asked you to ring the bell,
Katharine."</p>

<p>The girl walked across the room in a leisurely
manner, and did as she was told with
a great assumption of doing as she wished.
Then she sat on the arm of the nearest chair,
and the rebellious look returned to her face.</p>

<p>"How do you know it is daddy's fault,
Aunt Esther? The Stoke road is awfully
bad, and it's blowing hard from the north-west.
He may have been kept, and cold
soup's beastly. I think it's a shame."</p>

<p>"I really wish," complained Miss Esther,
"that you would try and control your expressions,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
Katharine. It all comes of your romping
so much with young Morton. Of course
I am a mere cipher in my own house; but
some day your father will be sorry that he
did not listen to me in time. Can you never
remember that you are not a boy?"</p>

<p>"I am not likely to forget," muttered
Katharine. "I should not be sticking in this
stupid old place if I were. I should be working
hard for daddy, so that he could live with
his books and be happy, instead of grinding
his life away for people who only want to get
all they can out of him. What's the use of
being a girl? Things are so stupidly arranged,
it seems to me!"</p>

<p>"My dear," said Miss Esther, who had
only caught the end of her speech, "it is
difficult to believe that your father is one of
God's chosen ministers."</p>

<p>"But he isn't," objected Katharine. "That's
just it. They made him go into the church
because there was a family living; so how on
earth could he have been chosen? Why, you
told me so yourself, Aunt Esther! It's all
rubbish about being chosen, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Don't chatter so much," said Miss Esther,
who was counting her stitches; and Katharine
sighed petulantly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span></p>

<p>"I can't think," she went on to herself,
"how he was ever weak enough to give
in. He must have been absent-minded
when they ordained him, and never discovered
it until afterwards! Don't you think
so, Dorcas?"</p>

<p>But Dorcas, who had only just brought in
the soup, was hardly in a position to make the
necessary reply; and Katharine had to content
herself with laughing softly at her own
joke. The meal passed almost in silence, and
they had nearly finished before they heard the
sound of wheels on the wet gravel outside.
Miss Esther looked up, and listened with her
chronic air of disapproval.</p>

<p>"Dear me," she sighed, "your father has
driven round to the stable again by mistake.
What are you doing, Katharine? I was just
going to say grace."</p>

<p>But Katharine had already dispensed with
the ceremony by vanishing through the door
that led into the kitchen; and Miss Esther
hurried over it alone, and managed to be seated
in her chair near the reading-lamp, upright
and occupied, by the time her brother came
into the room. There was something pathetic
in the way she elaborated her little methods of
reproach for the sake of one on whom the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
small things in life made no impression at
all. And when the Rector entered, smiling
happily, with Katharine hanging on his arm
and whispering eager questions into his ear,
it was easy to see that his mind was occupied
by something far more engrossing than
the fact that he was late for supper. But
Miss Esther preserved her look of injury,
and the Rector, who was making futile
efforts to produce a paper parcel from the
pocket in his coat tails, suddenly gave up
the attempt as he caught sight of her, and
began to smooth his sleek white hair with a
nervous hand.</p>

<p>"Yes, Esther," he said, although she had
not spoken a word.</p>

<p>"We have sent away the soup, but there is
some cold meat on the side, I believe. Katharine,
do be seated instead of romping round
the room like that! Your father can see to
himself," was all that Miss Esther said.</p>

<p>"Yes, Esther," said the Rector submissively;
and he helped himself to some apple
pie, and sat thoughtfully with the knife in
his hand until Katharine came and replaced
it with a fork. "It is a windy night," he
continued, as no one seemed inclined to say
anything. Miss Esther was waiting for her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
opportunity, and Katharine had caught the
infection of her mood, and was again absorbed
in her book on the hearthrug.</p>

<p>"Tom Eldridge came up about his dying
wife, and Jones's baby is no better," said Miss
Esther, presently.</p>

<p>"Dear, dear! how very unfortunate!" observed
the Rector, smiling.</p>

<p>"I said you must have been detained unexpectedly,"
continued Miss Esther, with more
emphasis. "They seemed very much in want
of a little counsel."</p>

<p>"I'm certain they weren't," said Katharine
audibly. "Eldridge wanted some more port
wine, and Mrs. Jones came to see what she
could get. And I don't fancy either of them
got it."</p>

<p>"Very unfortunate!" said the Rector again.
"I was certainly detained, Esther, as you
cleverly divined,&mdash;unavoidably detained."</p>

<p>"People," said Miss Esther, very distinctly,
"who have spiritual brothers and sisters
depending upon them, have no right to be
detained."</p>

<p>"I never can think," put in Katharine,
"how any one has the courage to be a clergyman.
It simply means having crowds of
relations, dull, sordid, grasping relations, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
come and rob you systematically in the name
of the Lord."</p>

<p>"A spiritual man," continued Miss Esther,
without heeding the interruption, "is not&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, auntie," implored Katharine, "do let
daddy eat his supper in peace."</p>

<p>"My child," interposed the Rector gently,
"I have finished my supper. Does Eldridge
expect me to do anything to-night, Esther?
Or Mrs. Jones?"</p>

<p>"My dear Cyril," said Miss Esther sternly,
"if your own instincts do not prompt you to
do anything, I should say they had better go
untended."</p>

<p>The Rector sighed, and played with his knife.
He was looking like a schoolboy in disgrace.
Katharine gave a scornful little laugh.</p>

<p>"What <i>is</i> the good of making all that fuss
over a trifle? Just as though the cough of
Jones's baby were half as important as the
genuine rat-tail daddy has picked up at
Walker's!"</p>

<p>The murder was out, and Miss Esther put
down her knitting and prepared for a characteristic
outburst. But the Rector had already
unwrapped his treasure and placed it on the
table before him, and her bitterest reproaches
fell unheeded on his ears.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span></p>

<p>"Genuine sixteenth century," he murmured,
as he stroked it reverently with his long, thin
fingers.</p>

<p>"Only yesterday," said the strident voice of
his sister, "you were telling me you had no
money for a soup kitchen. It was a poor living,
you said; and now&mdash;&nbsp;How can you set
such an example,&mdash;you with a mission in life?"</p>

<p>"I vow I'll never have a mission in life,"
said Katharine, "if it means giving up everything
that makes one happy. Poor daddy!"</p>

<p>"One of Christ's elect," continued Miss
Esther, "to be turned aside for a bit of tawdry
pewter! For what you can see in a tarnished,
old-fashioned thing like that, is more than I
can understand."</p>

<p>The Rector looked up for the first time.</p>

<p>"Indeed, Esther," he said in a hurt tone,
"it is a fine piece of sixteenth century silver."
Katharine cast a wrathful look at the stern
figure near the reading-lamp, and came over to
her father's side. The rebellious note had
gone from her voice altogether as she spoke to
him.</p>

<p>"Let me look, daddy, may I?" she asked.
Cyril Austen pulled her on to his knee, and
they bent together over the old spoon. Miss
Esther knitted silently.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span></p>

<p>"Let me see," said the Rector presently,
turning an unruffled countenance towards his
sister, "what were we saying? About some
parishioners, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Parishioners? How can you talk of parishioners,
when the first trivial temptation
draws you from the right path and&mdash;and
makes you late for meals? Isn't it enough to
neglect your sacred duty, without upsetting the
household as well? Coming in at this time of&mdash;what
is it now, Cyril?"</p>

<p>For a worried look had suddenly crossed
the Rector's face. He pulled out his watch,
and consulted it with the nervous haste of a
man who is constantly haunted by having
forgotten something.</p>

<p>"Let me see,&mdash;how very stupid of me," he
said, laughing slightly. "I fancy there was
something else, now; whatever could it have
been, I wonder? It was not the spoon,
Esther, that made me late. Kitty, my child,
what did I say to you when I came in, just
now?"</p>

<p>"You said, 'I have picked up a genuine
rat-tail at Walker's;' and then you gave your
hat to Jim, and hung up the whip on the
hat peg!"</p>

<p>"Bad child!" said the Rector, still looking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
uneasily about him. "I wonder if Jim would
know?"</p>

<p>But here a light was thrown on the matter
by the entrance of Dorcas, who brought the
ambiguous message from Jim that the pony
was ready to start again, if the Rector was
"going to do anything about the poor creature
down agin the chalk pit."</p>

<p>"Bless my soul!" exclaimed the Rector.
"To be sure, that was it. Esther, brandy and
blankets, my dear,&mdash;anything you've got!
We must bring him home at once, of course.
I knew there was something. Esther, will
you&mdash;? Ah, she always understands."</p>

<p>For, to do her credit, Miss Esther never
wasted her time in reproaches when there was
really something to be done; and in the bustle
that followed, while the pony carriage was being
filled with everything that could be of use in
case of an accident, Katharine found herself left
in the hall, with the intolerable feeling of being
neglected, and burning with curiosity as to the
cause of it all.</p>

<p>"Daddy, daddy, what is it? Is any one
hurt? Mayn't I come too?" she pleaded,
as the Rector came out to look for his coat.</p>

<p>"Eh, what? Oh, a poor fellow broken his
leg in the chalk pit. Doctor's with him now.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
What is he like? Kind of tourist, I should
fancy; evidently didn't see his way in the
dark. There, run off to bed, Kitty; you'll
hear all about it in the morning."</p>

<p>"But I want to hear <i>now</i>," said the child,
quivering with impatience. "What sort of
man is he, daddy? Shall I like him, do you
think? Oh, do tell, daddy!"</p>

<p>"My child, I hardly noticed. My hat&mdash;ah,
thanks! He had a black beard, I fancy,&mdash;quite
young though, I should say,&mdash;and
a sallow face&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How unhealthy it sounds; and I hate
unhealthy people! I don't think I want
to go now," said Katharine, in an altered
tone.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, when the unwilling pony was
being urged again into the storm and the darkness,
some one slipped through the little group
in the porch, and sprang into the carriage beside
the Rector. And the Rector, who was incapable
of a decided action himself and never disputed
one on the part of others, threw the rug
over her knees, and they drove off together
to the scene of the accident. It was a wild,
black night; and the Rector shivered as he
bent his head to the furious gusts of wind, and
allowed the pony to struggle on feebly at its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
own pace. But Katharine sat upright with
her head thrown back, and would have liked
to laugh aloud as the wind caught her long
loose hair and lashed it, wet with rain, across
her face.</p>

<p>The chalk pit was situated at the further
end of the village; on a fine day, it might have
been reached in a ten minutes' drive, but to-night
it was nearly half an hour before the
pony managed to bring its load to a standstill
beside the group of men who had been waiting
there since dusk. Katharine recognised
all the village familiars who came forward at
their approach,&mdash;the doctor, who had tended
her childish maladies; the schoolmaster, who
had taught her to read; the churchwarden,
who still loved to tell her stories that she
had long ago learnt to know by heart. But
she had no eyes for any of these to-night;
she looked beyond them all, as she jumped
lightly out of the carriage, at the man who lay
on the ground with his eyes closed. A lantern
hung from the branch above, and swung to and
fro in the wind, casting intermittent gleams of
light across his face.</p>

<p>He opened his eyes wearily as the Rector
came forward, and they rested at once upon
Katharine, who stood bending over him with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
the rather heartless curiosity of a very young
girl.</p>

<p>"Kitty, move out of the way, my child,"
the Rector's voice was saying.</p>

<p>"I don't think he looks unhealthy at all,"
said Katharine dreamily.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p>The sun rose, the following morning, on a
scene of devastation. The storm of the previous
night had come at the end of a month's
hard frost, and everything was in a state of
partial thaw. Glistening pools of water lay in
the fields on the top of the still frozen ground,
looking like patches of snow in the pale sunshine;
and a curious phenomenon was discernible
in the brooks and the ditches, where a
layer of calm water covered the ice that still
bound the flowing stream below. The only
trace of last night's gale was a distant moaning
in the tree-tops; while above was a deepening
blueness of sky and a growing warmth in
the sunshine. There was winter still on the
ground, and the beginning of spring in
the air.</p>

<p>Two women had met under the beech-trees
at the edge of the chalk pit. Early as it was
they had already collected large bundles of
sticks; for the beauty of the morning was
nothing to them, and the storm, as far as they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
were concerned, merely meant the acquisition
of firewood. They had matter for conversation
enough, however; and it was this that
was making them loiter so early in the morning
near the scene of yesterday's accident.</p>

<p>"Is it the poor thing what fell down yonder,
you be a-talkin' of, Mrs. Jones? 'Cause I
see Jim hisself this blessed morning, I did,
and you can't tell me nothing I doan't know
already, you can't, Mrs. Jones," said Widow
Priest with fine scorn.</p>

<p>There was a jealousy of long standing between
the two neighbours. Mrs. Jones was
the sturdy wife of the sexton, and her family
was both large and increasing,&mdash;a fact which
she attributed entirely to Providence; though,
when three of them succumbed to insufficient
food and care, she put down their loss to the
same convenient cause, and extracted as much
consolation as she could out of three visits to
the churchyard. Widow Priest, on the other
hand, had buried no one in the little churchyard
on the hill. For her husband had committed
suicide, and they had laid him to an
uneasy rest without the sedative of a religious
ceremony; and his widow was thus robbed
even of the triumph of alluding to his funeral.
So her widowhood did not bring her its usual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
compensations; and she felt bitter towards the
wife of the sexton, who had buried her three
and kept five others, and would probably replace
the lost ones in time.</p>

<p>"I bain't so fond o' gossiping nor what you
be, Widow Priest," returned Mrs. Jones in
loud, hearty tones. "I got no time for talking
wi' strangers here an' strangers there, wi' my
man an' five little 'uns to do for. An' then
there's always the three graves of a Saturday
to tidy up, which you ain't got, poor thing;
not but what I'm saying it be your fault, in
course, Widow Priest."</p>

<p>Widow Priest gave a contemptuous sniff
as she sat down to tie up her fagots, and Mrs.
Jones remained standing in front of her, with
one arm thrown round her bundle of sticks,
and the other placed akimbo, an effective
picture of triumphant woman.</p>

<p>"Touching the poor thing what broke his
back yonder," she continued cheerfully: "I
was putting the baby to bed at the time, I
was, and I see the whole thing happen from
my top window, I did. He jumped the fence,
all careless like, jest as though he didn't know
the pit were there for sure. An' straightway
he tripped up, he did, an' down he went. God
help him, I says! An' I puts the baby down,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
an' I says to our Liz, 'Here, my child,' I
says, 'stand by your precious brother while
I goes across to the pit,' I says. An' jest
as I says that, up comes the Rector an' the
doctor with him, driving friendly like together
they was. So I says to our Liz, 'It's Providence,'
I says, 'what sent they two blessed
creatures here this day,' I says. An' I caught
up my shawl, I did, an' went hollerin' after
them. 'What is it, Mrs. Jones?' says the
Rector, 'is it the baby again?'&mdash;'Baby?' I
says, 'no, sir; not but what it racks me to
hear that child cough, it do. There be a man
yonder,' I says, 'jest broke his neck down
agin the chalk pit.' Lord! it were a sight
to see they two men turn that pony round!
An' the rain were that bad, it give me lumbago
all down my back, that did. Not but what
I soon got back to baby again, poor little
angel, with a cough that makes my heart ache,
to hear it going jest like the others did afore
they died. But ye didn't see him fall in,
now; did ye, Widow Priest?"</p>

<p>The widow shouldered her fagots grimly,
and stalked off with dignity. When she
reached the bend of the road, she turned
round and shouted a parting word in a tone
of unmitigated contempt.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span></p>

<p>"It bain't his neck, <i>nor</i> his back, Mrs.
Jones. It be both his legs, an' he be at the
Rectory now, in the best bedroom, he be;
an' there he'll likely stop a month or two,
Jim says, he do. But Jim didn't give ye a
call perhaps, Mrs. Jones?"</p>

<p>"Bless ye, Widow Priest, I ain't told ye
half what I know," cried Mrs. Jones. "You
be a poor thing, you be, if ye can't stand to
hear a body's tale; an' you that's so lonesome
too, an' got no one to do for, like I have.
Lord, what a hurry some folk do be in, for
sure! Eh, but that be Miss Katharine yonder,
blest if it ain't; an' Widow Priest be out
o' sight, too! I reckon as Miss Katharine
knows more nor Jim, an' I be going&mdash;"</p>

<p>But a wail from the cottage opposite awakened
the mother's sense of duty, and she
hastened across the road and forgot all about
the accident in an immediate necessity for
castigation.</p>

<p>Katharine came over the brow of the hill
that sloped down towards the chalk pit, scaled
the wooden fence at the bottom, and skirted the
edge of the little chasm until she came to
the line of beech-trees. Here she paused for
a moment, pecked a hole in the soft ground
with her heel, and peered thoughtfully down
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
into the pit. Then she turned abruptly away
again, and struck across the fields to the further
side of the village, where she sped down a
grassy lane that was for the most part under
water, and stopped at last before a gap in the
hedge that was hardly large enough to be
noticeable. She squeezed adroitly through it,
however, and came in view of an ugly modern
house standing in a neglected looking garden,
with an untidy farmyard and some stable
buildings at the back. Here she was careful
to keep a clump of box-trees between herself
and the front of the house, until she could
come out with safety into the open and approach
the iron fence that separated the paddock
from the lawn. This she vaulted easily,
dropping lightly on the grass beyond, and
managed to arrive at last unnoticed, under a
small oriel window at the corner of the house.
She picked up a handful of small stones, and
swung them with a sure aim at the little glass
panes, and called, "Coo-ey," as loudly as she
dared.</p>

<p>"Lazy toad!" she muttered impatiently.
"On a morning like this, too! And just
when I had got a real adventure to tell him,
that he knows absolutely nothing about, not
anything at all!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span></p>

<p>She did not throw up any more stones, but
mounted the iron railings instead, and sat
there with her feet dangling and her eyes
fixed on the oriel window.</p>

<p>"It's the biggest score I've ever had over
him," she chuckled to herself. "I think I
shall <i>explode</i> soon, if he doesn't wake up.
I'm getting so awfully hungry, too; it must
be eight o'clock."</p>

<p>She called again presently, without changing
her position; and this time there was a
sign of life behind the oriel window, and
the curtains were drawn aside. Katharine forgot
all her previous caution, and gave a loud
"whoop" of satisfaction. The lattice flew
open, and some one with rumpled hair and
flushed cheeks looked out and yawned.</p>

<p>"Don't make such a shindy, Kit; you'll
wake the mother," he grumbled. "Why the
dickens have you come so beastly early?"</p>

<p>"Because Aunt Esther was asleep, of course,"
answered Katharine promptly. "Hurry up,
Ted, and have your bath; it'll make you feel
piles better. And you'll have to get me some
food; I could eat my boots."</p>

<p>"Don't do that," said Ted. "Last night's
steak will do just as well."</p>

<p>"How is <i>she</i>?" asked Katharine, with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
jerk of her head towards the front of the
house.</p>

<p>"Awful. She's getting worse. She docks
the pudding course at supper now. Don't
go, Kitty; I'll be down directly."</p>

<p>He was not long, but she was full of impatient
reproaches by the time he joined her
at the fence.</p>

<p>"I believe you'd like to give the world
a shove to make it go round quicker," he
retorted, swinging himself up beside her.</p>

<p>"Well, you surely don't think it moves
very fast now, do you?" she said. "At
all events, Ivingdon doesn't," she added
emphatically.</p>

<p>"Well, what did you come for, old chum?"
he asked, smiting her shoulder with rough
friendliness. "Not to complain of this slow
old hole, I bet?"</p>

<p>"Get me something to eat, and I'll tell
you."</p>

<p>"Oh, hang, Kitty! I can't. Cook will
swear, or go to the mother, or something.
Can't you wait till you get home?"</p>

<p>"No, I can't. And I didn't tell you to go
to cook, or to <i>her</i>; did I, stupid? Isn't there
a pantry window, and isn't the larder next to
the pantry, and aren't the servants having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
breakfast in the kitchen, out of the way?
Eh?"</p>

<p>"Well, I'm bothered! But I can't get up
to that window, anyhow."</p>

<p>"There's a loose brick just below, and you
<i>know</i> it, you lazy boy! What's the use of
being exactly six foot, if you can't climb into
a window on the ground floor? <i>I</i> can, and
I'm only five foot four. Oh, you needn't
bother, if you're afraid! I can keep my news,
for that matter."</p>

<p>"I don't believe there is any news. Why,
I only saw you yesterday afternoon. And
nothing ever happens in Ivingdon. You are
only rotting, aren't you, Kit?"</p>

<p>"All right; I don't want to tell you, I'm
sure. Good-bye," said Katharine, without
moving a step.</p>

<p>He called himself a fool, and told her she
was a beastly nuisance, and that of course there
wasn't any news, and he didn't want to hear
it if there was. And he finally strolled round
to the pantry window, as she knew he would,
and returned with a medley of provisions in
his hands. They laughed together at the odd
selection he had made,&mdash;at the cold pie he was
balancing on a slice of bread, and the jam tart
that crowned the jug of milk; and they fought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
over everything like two young animals, and
drank out of the same jug and spilled half its
contents, and ended in chasing one another
round the paddock for no reason whatever.</p>

<p>"Walk home with me, and I'll tell you the
news. Come on, Ted!" she cried.</p>

<p>"Guess I will, and chance it. If she
doesn't like my being late for breakfast she'll
have to do the other thing. Through with
you, Kitty, and don't make the hole any
larger! There's always the chance that she
might have it mended, in a spasm of extravagance,
and that would be so bally awkward
for us."</p>

<p>She told her news as they went swinging
along side by side over the wet fields, leaping
the pools of standing water, and switching
the wet twigs in each other's face. But they
grew quieter as the interest of the tale deepened;
and by the time Katharine had reached
the episode of the chalk pit, Ted was walking
gloomily along with his hands in his pockets
and his eyes bent on the ground.</p>

<p>"You always have all the luck, Kitty," he
said mournfully. "Why wasn't I there?
Think of the use I should have been in helping
him into the carriage; only think of it,
Kitty!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span></p>

<p>"You wouldn't have been a bit of good,"
she returned cruelly. "You're much too
clumsy. They wouldn't even let Jim or
daddy help. <i>I</i> held his head, so there!"</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose I could have held his
beastly head, too, couldn't I?" roared Ted.</p>

<p>"It wasn't a beastly head; it was awfully
nice,&mdash;hair all silky, not baby's curls like
yours," said Katharine scornfully. "And
wasn't he plucky, too! His leg must have
hurt frightfully, but he just didn't say a word
or utter a sound. All the way home, whenever
the thing jolted him, he just screwed up
his mouth and looked at me, and that was all.
It was the finest thing I've ever seen."</p>

<p>"But you haven't seen much," said Ted.</p>

<p>"No, I haven't. But I've seen you squirm
when you had toothache. And you're not
fit to speak to if you have an ordinary headache,"
laughed Katharine.</p>

<p>They walked the rest of the way in silence.</p>

<p>"That is where he lies now," said Katharine,
with a dramatic gesture towards the spare-room
window. Her cheeks were red with excitement,
and she never noticed the look on Ted's
face as he shrugged his shoulders and made a
great pretence of whistling carelessly.</p>

<p>"What sort of a chap is he? Some tourist
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
bounder, I suppose," he condescended to
say.</p>

<p>"He isn't a bounder. He has awfully
nice hands,&mdash;white, and thin, and soft. He's
rather pale, with a lot of black hair and a
curly beard."</p>

<p>"What a played-out chap to make such a
fuss about!" said Ted, turning away contemptuously.
"Sounds more like a monkey than
anything else. Good-bye. I wish you joy
of him!"</p>

<p>"I suppose I'll see you again some time?"
she called after him.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; I suppose so."</p>

<p>"And it <i>was</i> news, wasn't it, Ted?"</p>

<p>"You seem to think so, anyway."</p>

<p>"Poor Ted!" She laughed, and ran indoors.
But he had hardly crossed the first
field before she had caught him up again,
breathless and penitent.</p>

<p>"I didn't mean it, Ted; I didn't, <i>really</i>,
old boy. It wasn't news, and he <i>is</i> a monkey,
and I'm a horrid pig. Come up after lunch,
won't you, Ted? I promise not to talk about
him once, and I want to show you something.
You will come, Ted, won't you?"</p>

<p>She flung her arms round him in her impulsive
way, and gave him one of her rough,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
playful hugs. But for the first time in his
life, Ted shook her off stiffly, and hastened on.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked Katharine,
more perplexed than annoyed.</p>

<p>"Oh, all right; I'll come. Don't be a
fool, Kitty!" he jerked over his shoulder; and
she turned away, only half satisfied, and went
slowly into the house. It was characteristic
of her that the smallest lack of response from
some one else would change her mood immediately;
and when she entered the dining-room
a few minutes later, her vivacity was all gone,
and the first words she caught of the conversation
at the breakfast-table only helped to
irritate her still further.</p>

<p>"Oh, bother Mr. Wilton!" she said crossly.
"The whole house seems to have gone mad
over Mr. Wilton. I am tired of hearing his
name."</p>

<p>The Rector seemed unconscious of her remark,
and only pulled her hair softly as she
slipped into the chair beside him. But Miss
Esther stopped abruptly in the middle of a
sentence, and cast a meaning glance towards
Katharine which her father did not see, though
she of course did.</p>

<p>"My dear," said Mr. Austen, in reply to
his sister, "I am sure you are quite competent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
to do it. Nancy always said you were
a born nurse; and Nancy knew, bless her!
Besides, the poor young man has been sent to
us in his affliction, and there is nothing else
to be done, is there? My child, it will not
interest you; we were only saying that Mr.&mdash;Wilton,
is it?&mdash;would require careful nursing;
and your aunt&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Really, Katharine, there is no necessity
for you to interfere. You know too much as
it is, and this question is not one that concerns
you at all. Perhaps you will keep to the
matter in hand until it is settled, Cyril!"</p>

<p>"My dear, I thought it was settled," said
the old man mildly. "The poor young fellow
has to be nursed, and you are the best
person to do it. So there is nothing else, is
there, Esther, that need detain me? I am
rather anxious&mdash;that is, I would like to finish
my paper on the antiquities of the county,
and it is already ten minutes past&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is a most extraordinary thing," interrupted
Miss Esther irritably, "that you never
will give your attention to anything that really
matters. You totally misunderstand my meaning,
Cyril. How can I, your sister and a
single woman, with due propriety&mdash;Katharine,
you can go and feed the chickens."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span></p>

<p>Katharine did not move, and the Rector
got up from his chair.</p>

<p>"My dear," he remonstrated, "I think you
over-estimate the difficulty. It is the duty of
the woman to look after the sufferer, is it not?
I really think there is nothing more to be said
about it. Meanwhile&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't know why you are in such a hurry,
Cyril; it is the day for the library to be
cleaned, so you cannot use it yet. The whole
business is most inopportune; why should he
break his leg in Ivingdon, when he might have
done it quite conveniently in the county town,
and been taken to the infirmary like any one
else?"</p>

<p>The Rector wondered vaguely why his room
was cleaned more than once a week; but he
sat down again and folded his hands, and said
that he was of the same opinion as before and
saw no reason why the unfortunate young
man should not be nursed by Miss Esther.</p>

<p>"No more do I," said Katharine. "What's
the difference between nursing Shepherd Horne
through bronchitis and nursing Mr. Wilton
with a broken leg, except that Mr. Wilton is
presumably not so unwashed? I never can
see why the poor people should have the monopoly
of impropriety, as well as of the Scriptures.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
Besides, you can easily reduce him to
the level of a villager by reading the Psalms
to him every day. That would make you
feel quite proper, wouldn't it, auntie? And
I dare say he wouldn't mind it much, when
he got used to it."</p>

<p>"Your profanity," said her aunt severely,
"is becoming perfectly outrageous. If you
were sometimes to say a few words of reproof
to your own daughter, Cyril, instead of dreaming
your life away&mdash;but there, I must go
and look after poor Mr. Wilton! I wonder
whether he likes his eggs boiled or scrambled?"
she added doubtfully. For Miss
Esther was one of those women who reserve
the best side of their nature for the people who
have no real claim upon them; and she took
little interest in any one who was neither poor
nor afflicted. The unpractical temperament
of the Rector both astonished and chafed her,
and she had nothing but a fretful endurance
for her high-spirited niece, in whom a natural
longing for action and an inordinate sense of
humour were fast producing a spirit of revolt
and cynicism. But an invalid, who was thus
thrown suddenly into her power, appealed
strongly to the Rector's sister; and her diffidence
had entirely disappeared by the time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
she had gone through all the objections that
propriety impelled her to raise.</p>

<p>"I feel quite thankful," she said, smiling
blandly, "that the poor fellow has fallen into
such good hands."</p>

<p>"So do I," remarked Katharine, as the
door closed. "It will be all the better for
your paper on the local antiquities, won't it,
daddy? Daddy <i>dear</i>, just think of all the
time we shall have to ourselves, now that
she's got Mr. Wilton on her hands! Poor
Mr. Wilton! Let's come and clear Dorcas
out of the library and look at what you've
done, shall we? Come along, daddy, <i>quick</i>!"</p>

<p>The Rector stroked her long hair, with a
doubtful look on his face.</p>

<p>"I am afraid, Kitty, I do not look after
you as I should," he said. "I am a bad old
sinner, eh?"</p>

<p>"That's why I love you so. You are a
brick!" exclaimed Katharine.</p>

<p>And she dragged him impetuously out of
the room.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p>Meanwhile, Paul Wilton lay wearily in the
old-fashioned guest-room over the porch. The
pain of his broken limb had kept him awake
most of the night; and now that the suffering
was less the discomfort remained, and he felt
no more inclined to sleep than before. With
a kind of mechanical interest he had watched
the pale light on his striped blind grow deep
and red, and then again pale and bright, as the
sun came up over the hills. His restlessness
increased as the time wore on; the sensation
of being unable to move began to grate on his
nerves, and he wished impatiently that something
would break the stillness of the house,
and awaken the people in it who were sleeping
so unreasonably. He raised himself on his
elbow as a light step came along the passage
outside, and sank back again with a feeling
of disappointment when it passed his door,
and went downstairs into the garden. In
reality it was much earlier than he thought;
and it was still some time longer before the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
usual early morning sounds testified to the
existence of a maid. He heard the stairs being
swept, and suffered silently as the broom was
struck clumsily against his wall in its downward
course. Then the front door, was unbolted
with a good deal of noise, and a few
mats were banged together in the open air, and
something was done with the door scraper. A
conversation, held across the lawn with Jim,
had the effect of an altercation, though it was
in reality only an inquiry on the subject of
milk, shouted shrilly in broad dialect. Later
on, came the welcome crackle of a fire and the
clatter of teacups; and a smell of hot bacon
began to pervade the air.</p>

<p>"At all events, that means breakfast," muttered
Paul. "It is not to be hoped that it
will be worth eating, but at least it will bring a
human being into the room. I wonder why
ordinary people never have any ideas for breakfast
beyond hot bacon! It is sure to be in
thick chunks, too, and salt, oh, very salt!
Don't I know it? It recalls my childhood.
There will be eggs, too,&mdash;there always were
eggs when we had visitors; and bad coffee
made by unaccustomed hands, also because
there is a visitor. I know that coffee too. On
the whole, it is wiser to keep to tea in strange
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
places of this sort, although one knows beforehand
that it will be thick, and black, and flavourless.
I know the tea, best of all. In quite
decent houses, one gets that tea."</p>

<p>Nobody came to him, although there were
other voices about the house now; and he
turned from his dissertation on food to a study
of the pictures on the wall. They were of the
class that had also been known to him in his
childhood; and he smiled sardonically as he
glanced at the two texts hidden in a maze of
illumination, and the German print of John the
Baptist standing in layers of solid water, and
the faded photograph of a baby girl with tangled
curls and a saucy mouth. Something in
the shape of that mouth suggested the shadowy
events of last night to his mind, and brought
with them the vague recollection of a girl's
face looking curiously down at him, and the
pleasurable sensation of being supported by
two firm, soft hands. He rather liked dwelling
on that part of last night's adventures,
until a real twinge of pain in his leg recalled
also the less pleasant episodes, and he shuddered
as he remembered the horrors of his
transit from the chalk pit to the Rectory.</p>

<p>"I hate being in pain; it is so vulgar," he
muttered distastefully; and a dread crossed his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
mind lest his suffering should become more
than he could bear with dignity.</p>

<p>A timid knock came outside the door, and
the maid entered to draw up the blind. She
looked clumsy, and Paul sighed. She sidled
along the wall to the door again as soon as she
could, and asked shyly when he would have
his breakfast.</p>

<p>"As soon as you like; and&mdash;er&mdash;Mary,
would you kindly give me that coat? What's
the time? And is it a fine day?" asked Paul
hurriedly. He was almost childish in his
anxiety to keep her in the room for another
moment. But to be called by the cook's name
so far confused her that she vanished precipitately;
and Paul smiled, a little more cynically
than before, and returned to his observations
of the pictures. Just then he heard the end
of the conversation between the boy and girl,
under his window, and was amused at his own
share in their quarrel.</p>

<p>"Anyhow, if that young woman is going to
be about, it may not be so bad, after all," he
reflected.</p>

<p>He was reduced to despondency again, however,
by the arrival of the breakfast, which
fully realised his expectations. For one who
professed to have a wide grasp of life, Paul
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
Wilton was singularly affected by trifles. His
spirits were not raised when he found who his
nurse was to be; and, competent as Miss
Esther soon proved herself, he remained convinced
that the child with the joyous laugh
who made so much merriment about the house,
would have suited him far better. And again,
he was amused at his interest in some one
whom he had hardly seen, and who would probably
turn out to be an undeveloped schoolgirl,
some one who would ride roughshod
over his susceptibilities, and even fail to understand
his feelings about things. It seemed
impossible to him that he should be able to
endure any one who did not understand his
feelings about things. She might be plain,
too; women with fascinating voices were often
extremely plain. And if she were neither
mature nor attractive, there could be no object
in giving her another thought; for woman,
to Paul Wilton, was merely an interesting
necessity,&mdash;like his food; something to fill
up the gaps that were not occupied by work,
or art, or any of the real things of life;
and something, therefore, to be taken in as
delicate a manner as possible. He liked to
talk to beautiful women in picturesque surroundings,&mdash;to
play on their emotions, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
to dally with their wit; but the women had
to be beautiful, and their setting had to be
appropriate.</p>

<p>"Please do not trouble to wait," he said to
Miss Esther in the afternoon, when he found
her preparing to sit with him. "I shall be
quite happy if you will have the goodness to
give me the paper and the cigarette case.
Thanks."</p>

<p>When she had gone, having lacked the
courage to tell him that tobacco smoke had
never yet polluted the sacred mustiness of the
best spare room, Paul lay back with a sense
of relief, and began to review his situation
gloomily.</p>

<p>"How I could have made such an ass of
myself, I don't know," he murmured. "Foisting
myself on complete strangers for six or
seven weeks at least! And such strangers,
too! Good Lord, how shocked the dear lady
looked when I said I hadn't a relation left
who cared a hang whether I was alive or
dead. I must tell her, as an antidote, that my
father was a parson; I have known that to take
effect in the most ungodly circles. Perhaps, if
I could swear I should feel better. But I am
not a swearing man; besides, she might leave
me to that painfully dull maid if I did. And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
that would be a pity," he added reflectively;
"for, at least, she does know how to make a
fellow as comfortable as a fractured leg will let
him be."</p>

<p>A sudden shoot of pain made him turn his
head wearily on one side. He had told the
doctor, only that morning, that it was nothing,
and that he did not suffer much; and then had
been unreasonably disappointed at the professional
verdict that it was a simple fracture, and
presented no complications. He would have
liked to be an interesting case, at least.</p>

<p>"I wonder if I am likely to get a glimpse of
that jolly little girl," he went on, looking idly
at the faded photograph opposite. "It is
probably the one who steadied my head in
the dark, last night; the one who laughs,
too. A Philistine place like this could never
produce two of them. However, I shall never
find out as long as I am nursed by that dragon.
And after all, why trouble about it? It shows
what a baleful effect idleness can have upon a
man, when an unsophisticated parson's daughter
with a jolly laugh can&mdash;hullo!"</p>

<p>He heard voices on the landing, and listened
eagerly. There was the sound of a scuffle and
a stifled laugh, and some one shook the door
by falling clumsily against it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span></p>

<p>"Come in, do!" shouted Paul desperately,
and the door opened with a jerk.</p>

<p>"I say, did we disturb you, or anything?
I'm beastly sorry; but Kitty would rot so,
and I couldn't help it, really. And, I say,
I'm awfully sorry you're so hit up."</p>

<p>It was Ted, apologetic and self-conscious.
Paul smiled encouragingly; it was at least
some one to talk to, even if it was a boy under
twenty, for whose kind he had as a rule little
sympathy. He could see there was some one
else too, on the landing outside; so he smiled
a little more. It pleased him to have his curiosity
satisfied, though perhaps he would not
have liked it to be called curiosity.</p>

<p>"You see, Kitty will play so poorly," pursued
Ted, plunging his hands in his pockets
to give himself more confidence. "I shouldn't
have dreamt of bothering you like this, if it
hadn't been for Kitty."</p>

<p>"I am quite content to believe that it was
the fault of Miss Kitty, whose acquaintance I
have not the honour of possessing," said Paul
gravely. "But won't you come in a little
further, and explain matters?"</p>

<p>Ted came in a good deal further, just then,
assisted by an unexpected push between his
shoulders.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span></p>

<p>"It's so poor of Kitty; and it isn't my
fault, I swear it isn't!" said Ted, in an injured
tone. "You see, she wants me to say&mdash;Oh,
hang, Kit, do let a fellow explain! Well,
she says that&mdash;that&mdash;well, she wants to come
in too, don't you see? She doesn't see why
she should have to go and talk to horrid old
men in the village, when they won't let her
come in and talk to you; at least, that's
what she says. And she says it's all rotten
humbug&mdash;&nbsp;Well, you know you did! But
Miss Esther will about kill me when she finds
it out. Kitty never thinks of that, she's so
poor."</p>

<p>Paul smiled again, partly at himself for being
young enough to appreciate the childishness of
the situation.</p>

<p>"Where is Miss Esther?" he asked, like a
man, wisely.</p>

<p>"Oh, she's out right enough; but still&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Paul reflectively, "I recognise
that there are still difficulties in the way. But
don't you think, as I am decidedly as much
afflicted as the other horrid old men you mentioned,
and as Miss Esther is out, that&mdash;we
might all agree to vote it rotten humbug? Just
for a few minutes, you know!"</p>

<p>And Katharine, who had been listening
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
anxiously to every word, slipped into the
room at this point of the negotiations, and
closed the door; nodded cheerfully to Paul
as though she had known him all her life, and
dropped sideways on the chair at the end of
his bed.</p>

<p>"I knew you wouldn't mind," she said.
"Ted declared you would; but Ted's so
awfully dense sometimes, isn't he?"</p>

<p>Paul was willing to admit that, on this occasion,
Ted had been remarkably dense; but he
only murmured some commonplace about the
correctness of her judgment, and the honour he
felt at her discrimination.</p>

<p>"Oh, I <i>knew</i>!" said Katharine confidently.
"I am never wrong about people. Ted is.
He makes fearful hashes about people; I
always have to tell him who is to be trusted,
and who isn't."</p>

<p>"I should like to know," observed Paul,
"how you manage to know so much about
people whom you have never seen before,&mdash;myself,
for instance!"</p>

<p>"But I have seen you before! Oh, I forgot;
of course, you didn't know. I was with
daddy last night when he came to fetch you.
Don't you remember? I suppose you were
too bad to notice much."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span></p>

<p>"That must have been it," assented Paul.
"I just remember some one supporting my
head, or it may have been my shoulders&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It was your head. That was me!" cried
Katharine, with animation. "Wasn't Ted
jealous when I told him,&mdash;that's all!"</p>

<p>"I wasn't," said Ted. "But it was just
like Kitty. Girls always do have all the
luck."</p>

<p>"I am glad," said Paul drily, "that at least
one of you was fortunate enough to view my
discomfiture."</p>

<p>Ted laughed, but Katharine became suddenly
thoughtful.</p>

<p>"I was very sorry for you, I was really,"
she said.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, excuse me,&mdash;merely interested,"
said Paul.</p>

<p>Katharine reflected again.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I was; how caddish of me!" she
said, and looked at him doubtfully. Paul raised
his eyebrows; to be taken seriously by a
woman, at such an early stage of her acquaintance,
was a new experience to him.</p>

<p>"Oh, please," he exclaimed, laughing, "don't
be truthful whatever you are! It's much
more charming to think that you <i>were</i> sorry
for me."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span></p>

<p>Katharine still seemed puzzled. She turned
to Ted instinctively, and he came to her
rescue.</p>

<p>"She thought you were awfully plucky and
all that; she told me so. I was rather sick
about it, of course; but, after all, it wasn't
really worth minding because you were hit up
so completely, you see."</p>

<p>"You are a singularly brutal pair of young
people," observed Paul, glancing from one to
the other. "I should like you to have the
feel of my leg for half an hour. I fancy you
would find yourselves 'hit up,' as you are
pleased to call it."</p>

<p>"Oh, but we're not a bit brutal," objected
Katharine. "Ted never can help saying what
he thinks at the moment,&mdash;that's how it is.
It's because he shows all his feelings, don't
you see?"</p>

<p>"You mustn't think Kitty is unfeeling because
she doesn't say things," continued Ted.
"She hates spoofing people, and she never
says things she doesn't mean. She doesn't
always say them when she does mean them;
it's rather rough on a fellow sometimes, I
think," he added feelingly.</p>

<p>The garden gate swung to, and they sprang
to their feet simultaneously.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span></p>

<p>"Shall we scoot?" asked Ted, who seemed
the more apprehensive of the two.</p>

<p>"I suppose so. Bother!" said Katharine
regretfully. Ted was already gone, but she
still lingered. The flying visit to Paul, instead
of satisfying her curiosity about him, had
only roused it still more; and she sauntered
half absently towards him, without the least
pretence of being in a hurry to go.</p>

<p>"Good-bye," she said, and put her hand
into his. It was the first time she had shown
any signs of shyness, and Paul began to like
her better.</p>

<p>"Not good-bye," he said lightly. "You
will come in again, won't you? We shall
have a good lot to tell each other."</p>

<p>"Shall we?"</p>

<p>"Well, don't you think so?" He dropped
her hand and laughed. It seemed absurd that
this child, who behaved generally like a charming
tomboy, should persist in taking him seriously
when he merely wanted to frivol.</p>

<p>"I'll come if it won't bore you," said Katharine
shortly. She was wondering what there
was to laugh at.</p>

<p>"Can you write a tolerable hand?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"I write all daddy's things for him."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span></p>

<p>"Then we'll see if something can't be arranged,"
he began. He congratulated himself
on his tact in helping to gratify her evident
wish to see him again; but she baffled him
once more by suddenly brightening up, and
seizing upon his suggestion before he had half
formed it.</p>

<p>"Could I be your secretary, do you mean?
Why, of course I could. What fun! Aunt
Esther? Oh, that's nothing. <i>I</i> will manage
Aunt Esther. Good-bye."</p>

<p>She managed Aunt Esther very effectually
at supper time, by calmly announcing her intention
of becoming Mr. Wilton's secretary.
And the Rector's sister, who was a curious compound
of conventional dogma and worldly
ignorance, and knew into the bargain that it
was of no use to withstand her headstrong
niece, gave in to her newest whim with a bad
grace.</p>

<p>"Do as you like; I am no longer the
head of the house, I suppose," she observed
fretfully.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you are, Aunt Esther!" retorted
Katharine with provoking cheerfulness. "<i>I</i>
only want to be Mr. Wilton's secretary."</p>

<p>Paul was not so elated as she had expected
to find him, when she walked into his room in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
Miss Esther's wake on the following day,
and told him that she had gained her point
and was ready to become his secretary. Being
such a responsive creature herself, she always expected
every one else to share her emotions.</p>

<p>"Aren't you glad?" she asked him anxiously.</p>

<p>Not being able to explain that what he
wanted was not so much a secretary as a
pretty girl to amuse him, he said with his usual
smile that he was delighted, and proceeded to
dictate various uninteresting letters of a business-like
character.</p>

<p>"So you live in the Temple," she observed,
as she folded up a letter to his housekeeper.
"Isn't it a gloriously romantic place to live
in?"</p>

<p>"It is convenient," said Paul briefly. And
that was all the conversation they had that day.</p>

<p>He wanted no letters written the next day,
and she read the paper to him instead. But
Miss Esther stayed in the room all the time,
with her knitting, and there was no conversation
that day either. On the third day, however,
her aunt was wanted in the parish; and
she deputed the Rector to take her place in
the sick room. She might have known that
he would forget all about it, directly she was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
gone; but Miss Esther always acted on the
assumption that her brother possessed all the
excellent qualities she wished him to have, and
it never occurred to her that he would spend
the afternoon in finishing his paper on the
antiquities of the county.</p>

<p>"Aunt Esther has gone to see a poor woman
who has lost her baby. I never can imagine
why a woman who has lost her baby should
be visited just because she is poor. Can
you?" said Katharine, as she settled herself on
the spare-room window-seat with her writing
materials.</p>

<p>"No," said Paul, concealing his satisfaction
that Miss Esther was of a different opinion.
"You needn't bother about writing any letters
to-day, thanks," he continued carelessly; "and
I don't think I want to hear the paper, either."</p>

<p>"Don't you? oh!" said Katharine, looking
disappointed. "Then there's nothing I
can do for you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. You can talk, if you will," said
Paul, smiling. "Come and sit on the chair at
the end of the bed, where you sat the first day
you came in. I can see you, then."</p>

<p>"It is ever so much nicer to see the person
you are talking to, isn't it?" observed Katharine,
as she obeyed his suggestion.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span></p>

<p>"Much nicer," assented Paul, though it had
never occurred to him to suggest that Miss
Esther should occupy that particular chair.
"Now then, talk, please!"</p>

<p>Katharine made a sign of dismay.</p>

<p>"I can't," she said. "You begin."</p>

<p>"Who is your favourite poet?" asked Paul
solemnly. She disconcerted him by taking his
question seriously, and he had to listen to her
enthusiastic eulogies of several favourite poets,
before he had an opportunity of explaining
himself.</p>

<p>She detected him in the act of suppressing a
yawn, and she stopped suddenly, in the middle
of a sentence.</p>

<p>"I believe I am boring you dreadfully.
Shall I go?" she asked. The colour had
come into her cheeks, and her voice had a
note of distress in it.</p>

<p>"I want you to tell me something, first,"
was his unexpected reply. "Do you talk
about poetry to young Morton?"</p>

<p>"Ted? Why, no, of course not. What an
awful reflection! Ted isn't a bit poetic, not a
little bit; and he would scoff like anything. I
have never talked about the things I really
like to anybody before; not even to daddy,
much."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span></p>

<p>This was a little dangerous, and the tomboy
daughter of the parson was not the kind
of personality that was likely to make the danger
fascinating. And Paul's first impulse was
to wince at the unstudied frankness of her remark;
but four days of seclusion had been
exceedingly chastening, and the flattery that
underlay her words was not unpleasing to
him.</p>

<p>"Then what made you suppose <i>I</i> cared
about poetry, eh?" he asked deliberately.</p>

<p>"Why," said Katharine, staring at him,
"you began it, don't you remember? I
thought you wanted me to tell you what I
thought."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; I am aware of that. But don't
you think we have talked enough about poetry
for one day?" said Paul, half closing his eyes.
He was already regretting his stupidity in expecting
her to understand him.</p>

<p>"How awfully funny you are! First you
say&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Paul, as patiently as he could,
"I know. Don't let us say any more about
it. Supposing you were to talk to me now as
you would talk to young Morton, for instance!"</p>

<p>Katharine shook her head doubtfully.</p>

<p>"I don't think I could. You're not like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
Ted; you don't like the same sort of things.
You're not like me, either."</p>

<p>Paul smiled grimly.</p>

<p>"We're both the same in reality, Miss
Kitty. Only, you are focussing it from one
end, and I from another. I mean, you are too
abominably young and I am too abominably
old, for conversation. We shall have to keep
to the favourite poets, after all."</p>

<p>Katharine had come round to the side of the
bed, and was regarding him critically, with a
very serious look on her face.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" she asked abruptly.
"I hate people to say they are old&mdash;when
they are nice people. It makes me feel horrid;
I don't like it. I never let daddy talk
about growing old; it gives me a sort of cold
feel, don't you know? I wish you wouldn't.
Besides, I am not young, either; I am nearly
nineteen. I know I look much younger, because
I won't put my hair up; but my skirts
are nearly to the ground. What makes you
say I am too young to be talked to?"</p>

<p>"I said you were too young for conversation.
It is not quite the same thing, is it?"</p>

<p>"Isn't it?" said Katharine, and she looked
away out of the window for a full minute.
What she saw there she could not have told,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
but it was something that had never been there
before. When she brought her eyes round
again to his face, the serious look had gone out
of them, and they were twinkling with fun.
"I know!" she laughed. "Let's talk without
any conversation."</p>

<p>"She's the same woman, after all," was
Paul's reflection.</p>

<p>They did not mention the favourite poets
again; but they had no difficulty for the rest
of the afternoon in finding something to talk
about. It was getting late when the garden
gate gave its usual warning, and Katharine got
up with a sigh.</p>

<p>"When shall I see you again?" he asked.
They had not gone through the formality of
shaking hands, this time.</p>

<p>"When Aunt Esther has <i>not</i> gone to see a
poor woman who has lost her baby," said
Katharine, laughing.</p>

<p>"Nonsense! we will keep the letters and
the newspaper for that kind of visit. Won't
some one else die, don't you think, so that we
can have another talk?"</p>

<p>"I'll see," said Katharine, which could not
strictly be called an answer to his question.
But it fully satisfied Paul.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p>The weeks crept on; and Paul Wilton, from
being merely an object of interest and pity,
gradually became the greatest mystery in the
neighbourhood. Such a reputation was entirely
unsought on his part, although, had he
been aware of it, the probability is that it
would not have been wholly unpleasing to
him. For it had been his pose through life
to mystify people,&mdash;not by deliberately assuming
to be what he was not, but by strenuously
avoiding any appearance of what he was; and
his indifference, which was what people first
noticed in him, was entirely feigned for the
purpose of concealing that his real attitude
towards life was a critical one. It was not unreasonable
that a man of this calibre, suddenly
placed in a quiet country parish, should end
in making some sort of a sensation there.
Miss Esther from the beginning had suffered
much, and silently; but a man who had a
father in Crockford and a mother in Debrett,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
was to be forgiven a good deal, and she felt
compelled to overlook even the ash of his
cigarettes, and his French novels, when she
found them both on the chaste counterpane of
the best spare-room bed. But there were
others in Ivingdon who, not having much of
a pedigree themselves, were inclined to undervalue
the importance of one; and some of
these, the doctor, for instance, and Peter
Bunce the churchwarden, came to the Rector
for enlightenment.</p>

<p>"Eh, but he doan't give hisself away much,
do he, now?" said the churchwarden, jerking
his thumb in the direction of the lame man,
who had just swung himself past the window
on his crutches. "He be proper close, I
reckon, eh?"</p>

<p>"He is a very intelligent young man," said
the Rector vaguely. "He has quite an appreciation
of Oriental china."</p>

<p>It was Sunday afternoon, and the Rector
was dispensing whiskey and cigars to his
guests, with a prodigality that might have been
attributed to Miss Esther's absence at the
Sunday school. There was an ease, too, about
their manners and their conversation, which
was to be traced to the same cause.</p>

<p>"I suppose he's beastly clever, and all that,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
isn't he?" asked Ted morosely. He was
sitting on the window ledge, a convenient
position which allowed him to shout occasional
answers to the questions that came from Katharine
on the other side of the lawn. Just then,
however, she was joined by Paul; and Ted
knew instinctively that he would have no
more questions to answer after that.</p>

<p>"It is difficult to say what he is," observed
the doctor. "You can't get him to talk; at
least, not much. Generally, when I've done
all the professional business, he relapses into
total silence, and I just have to go; but sometimes
he is inclined to be chatty, and then he
makes a delightful companion. But the odd
thing is, that I know no more about the man
himself at the end of a conversation than I did
at the beginning. A barrister, did you say he
was? That accounts for the judicial manner,
then; but the question is, what is there behind
it all?"</p>

<p>No one seemed to have an answer ready to
the doctor's question; but Peter Bunce took
a long pull at the whiskey, and brushed the
cigar ash from his capacious waistcoat, and
attacked the subject with fresh vigour.</p>

<p>"There ain't no finding out anything about
no one, without you take a bit o' trouble," he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
remarked wisely. "Mayhap Mr. Austen, yonder,
might know a something more than us
folk. Hasn't he got never a father, now?
There's a won'erful lot to be gathered from
knowing of a man's father, there is. Like
enough he's one o' they London folk, as
daren't speak aloud for fear of its getting
into the newspapers. London folk is mighty
well watched, so I've heard; there's never
a moment's peace or safety in London, some
say. Mayhap Mr. Wilton's father is a London
gen'leman, now!"</p>

<p>"His father?" said the Rector, with sudden
enthusiasm. "His father was something short
of a genius, sir! He is the best authority we
have on the numismatics of his neighbourhood.
Have you never heard of Wilton's 'Copper
Tokens'?"</p>

<p>"Guess we have, sir, pretty often," laughed
Ted.</p>

<p>The Rector looked pathetic, and handed him
another cigar, with an apprehension that arose
from the distant clang of the garden gate.</p>

<p>"They all laugh at me," he said in a cheery
tone that evoked no one's pity. "I'm an old
fool; oh, yes, we know all about that. But if
you had read Wilton's 'Copper Tokens,' you
wouldn't want to know who this man's father
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
was. Let me see,&mdash;what did I do with my
Crockford?"</p>

<p>"I expect you thought it was a hymn-book
and carted it up to church this morning," said
Ted, in a tone of forced merriment. He still
had one eye on the lawn, and what he saw
there did not raise his spirits.</p>

<p>"Died at the age of fifty-eight, when his
son was a lad of eighteen, he tells me," continued
the Rector. "That was the same date
that the fifth edition of the 'Copper Tokens'
was issued, some ten or fifteen years ago now.
Bless me, how time flies when we're not growing
any younger!"</p>

<p>For the space of a moment or two, everybody
present was occupied with a mental calculation.
The churchwarden was the first to
give up the attempt, and he returned doggedly
to the original topic.</p>

<p>"Age ain't got nothing to do with it," he
began, heaving a sigh of relief as he substituted
his pipe for the unusual cigar. "'Cause
why? Some folk's old when they're young,
and other folk's young when they're old;
that's where it lays, you see."</p>

<p>Nobody did see; but Ted threw in a vicious
comment.</p>

<p>"The Lord only knows how old he is,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
but he's as played out as they make them,"
he said.</p>

<p>The churchwarden smiled, without understanding,
and Cyril Austen was too deep in
his Crockford to hear what was passing; but
the doctor had been young himself, not so
long ago, and he understood.</p>

<p>"Does he talk about leaving?" he asked
in a casual manner, directing his remark to
the boy on the window ledge. "There's
nothing to keep him here now, as far as I
can see."</p>

<p>"Don't know anything about him," said
Ted, with a studied indifference. "I should
have thought, from the way Kitty speaks of
him, that London couldn't do without him
for another moment. What they all see in
him, I don't know. I suppose it's because
I'm such a rotten ass, but he seems just like
anybody else to me as far as brains are concerned.
And he can't talk for nuts. But
Miss Esther says his family is all square; and
that's enough for the women, I suppose."</p>

<p>The doctor nodded sympathetically, and
Ted laughed as if he were a little ashamed
of taking himself so seriously.</p>

<p>"He's going to make himself scarce on
Wednesday," he continued, rather more cordially.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
"He's got a pal of his coming down
on business to-morrow, and they're going off
together. Good thing, too, eh? Don't know
anything about the pal&mdash;he's not any great
shakes, I expect; but Wilton swears he knows
a lot about coins, and of course that will fetch
the Rector. Fact is, this place is getting too
clever for me. There's Kitty, who rots about
poetry and things till it makes you sick. She
never used to; and it's no good her trying to
spoof you that she isn't altered, because she
is,&mdash;and all for the sake of a chap like Wilton,
who hardly ever opens his mouth! It's so
poor, isn't it?"</p>

<p>But here the arrival of Miss Esther postponed
any further discussion of the Rectory
guest. The doctor suddenly remembered that
he had a patient to visit, and took an abrupt
departure; and the churchwarden refused a
curt invitation to tea, and went hastily after
him. Ted lingered a moment or two, without
being noticed at all; and Miss Esther, having
successfully routed her brother's guests, went
into the garden to disturb the conversation on
the other side of the lawn.</p>

<p>Some two days later, Paul Wilton and his
friend from London were pacing up and down
the narrow strip of gravel path that skirted the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
house on the south side. In the absence of
Katharine, who had induced him to prolong
the period of helplessness, as he would have
wished to prolong any other pleasurable sensation,
Paul had no reason to play the invalid;
and, except for an occasional limp, there was
nothing in his walk to indicate lameness.
There was the usual inexplicable smile on his
face, however, as he listened to the bantering
conversation of the man at his side, and occasionally
interrupted it with one of his dry,
terse remarks. His companion was a little
elderly man, with small features and a fresh
complexion, whose geniality was the result of
temperament rather than of principle, and whose
conversation was toned with a personal refrain
that made it naïvely amusing.</p>

<p>"That's a pretty child, by the way," he was
saying, with the air of a connoisseur. Katharine
had just left them, and they could hear her
laughing with her father indoors. Paul murmured
an assent, and went on smoking. His
companion glanced at him sideways, and smiled
gently.</p>

<p>"Very pretty," he repeated, "but ridiculously
young. And who is the charming boy
who is so gone on her? She doesn't see it a
bit, and he hasn't the pluck to tell her. I'm
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
quite sorry for that boy; I've been in his shoes
many a time, and I know what it feels like.
He's got a lot to teach her, that's certain, eh?
Doesn't interest you, I suppose! If it had
been me, now, chained here with a broken leg
and nothing to do, with an idyllic love story
going on under my eyes&mdash;ah, well! you are
not made that way, and I am too old, I suppose.
Besides, in spite of her charm, she
isn't exactly my style."</p>

<p>"No," said Paul; "she is not your style."</p>

<p>"All the same, she's remarkably pretty, and
I'm not too old to admire a pretty woman,"
chuckled his companion. "'Pon my word,
I 'm quite inclined to envy that boy. Just
imagine a veritable woman, still thinking herself
a child, with a delightful boy for her only
companion, and no one to stand between them!
I'd have given worlds for such a chance when
I was his age."</p>

<p>"But, you see, you are not his age; so it is
no use trying to cut him out. Besides, you
ought to know better, Heaton, at your time of
life," said Paul, in a jesting manner that was a
little strained. Heaton took his remark rather
as a compliment than otherwise.</p>

<p>"You won't alter me, my boy; you'll find
me the same to the end of the chapter,&mdash;so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
make up your mind to that. I'm not ashamed
of it either, not I! Seriously, though, I'm
quite interested in our little love story yonder.
I should like to help that boy. Silly ass! why
doesn't he make a plunge for it? He isn't
likely to have a rival."</p>

<p>"Perhaps that is why he doesn't," observed
Paul. "But I don't see why we should
trouble ourselves about it."</p>

<p>"That's where you're so cynical," complained
Heaton. "These little affairs always
interest me intensely; they bring back my
youth to me, and remind me of my lost happiness.
Oh, life! what you once held for me!
And now it is all gone, buried with my two
sweet wives, and I am left alone with no one
to care what becomes of me."</p>

<p>His eyes were moist as he finished speaking,
and Paul walked along at his side without
offering any consolation. He would have
found it difficult to explain why he had chosen
Laurence Heaton for a friend. It would be
more correct to say, perhaps, that Heaton had
chosen him, and that he had lacked the energy
or the power to shake him off. It was generally
true that his sentimental egotism bored
Paul excessively, and yet he found something
to like in a nature that was so unlike his own;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
and he was so secretive himself that the artless
confidences of Heaton, if a little wearisome, at
least relieved him of the necessity of adding to
the conversation. Besides this, he was a man
who never willingly sought the friendship of
others, and the obvious preference that the
good-natured idler, who was so many years his
elder, had shown for him when they first
met at a public dinner, had secretly flattered
him not a little, and their acquaintance had
grown after that as a matter of course.</p>

<p>"All the same," resumed Heaton in his
ordinary manner, "an outsider never can do
much in these cases. Perhaps it would be
better to leave them alone; and yet, if the boy
were to come to me for the benefit of my
larger experience&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't you think," interrupted Paul, "that
we have talked about a couple of children as
much as we need? It's all very well for an
old reprobate like yourself to spend your time
in reviving your lost youth, but I haven't so
much leisure as you have, and I want to hear
about those shares you mentioned in your letter
last week."</p>

<p>Heaton laughed good-humouredly.</p>

<p>"You don't realise, my dear fellow, how
anything like that always interests me. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
you wait until your time comes; at present you
are too cynical to understand what I mean."</p>

<p>"Or too romantic," suggested Paul.</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" said Heaton. "Romance is only
an equivalent for inexperience; I think you're
a cold-hearted beggar who lets the best things
in life go by, but I shouldn't call you inexperienced.
You've got a finished way with
women that always appeals to them; women
love a little humbug, if it's well done. I'm
too obvious for them, too simple-minded, and
that always frightens them off."</p>

<p>"Does it?" smiled Paul.</p>

<p>"Now, you ought to marry," continued
Heaton briskly. "I believe in marriage,
hanged if I don't! and it's been the making
of me. Everything that is good in me I owe
to my married life."</p>

<p>"Did it really take two marriages?" murmured
Paul. His companion smiled at the
joke against himself, and they stood for a
moment in silence, looking over the lawn that
had just acquired its fresh bloom of green.
Katharine's voice came out to them again
through the open window, this time raised in
indignant dispute with her aunt.</p>

<p>"She is a curious mixture of hardness and
sentiment," said Paul involuntarily, "and her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
surroundings have made her a prig; but she
interests me rather."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Heaton, "I quite agree with
you. There <i>is</i> a touch of the prig about
her. But can you wonder? She is the only
bit of life and prettiness about the place,
and she never meets her equal. They
think a good lot of her, too. And the
parson's daughter generally thinks a good
lot of herself."</p>

<p>"She does it rather charmingly," said Paul,
in a dispassionate tone, "and she is fairly well
read, and knows how to express herself. For
a woman, she has quite a sense of criticism."</p>

<p>"That's bad," said Heaton decidedly, "very
bad. A woman should have no sense of criticism.
That is what makes her a prig. In
fact, as I have often said to you before, a prig
is made in three ways. First of all, she is
made by her own people, if she happens to be
clever; and secondly, by the world, if she happens
to be successful; and thirdly, by her lover,
if she isn't in love with him. But of course
if she <i>is</i> in love with him he may be the
cause of her unmaking."</p>

<p>Some one in a light-coloured print frock
jumped out of a side window and disappeared
in the direction of the summer-house. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
two men stood and looked after her without
being noticed.</p>

<p>"As you say," remarked Heaton blandly,
"she does it rather charmingly."</p>

<p>Paul roused himself with an effort.</p>

<p>"Half-past three," he said, looking at his
watch. "Didn't you promise to go and look
at the Rector's coins some time this afternoon?"</p>

<p>And in another five minutes he had joined
Katharine in the summer-house.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p>The summer house was set far back in the
shrubbery, and although hidden from the house
by laurels and box-trees, was open at the front
to a stretch of brightly coloured flower beds
and trimly cut grass. It was a glorious day
in May, and spring in its fulness was come.
The white fruit blossoms had given place to
crumpled green leaves, and the early summer
flowers were in bud. Paul Wilton lay on a
low basket chair, where he had flung himself
down after making his escape from his garrulous
friend; and at his feet, with an open book
on her lap, sat Katharine. Obviously, a great
many poor women had lost a great many
babies, since the day she had sat on the chair
at the end of his bed and talked about her
favourite poets, for the book on her lap was
only a pretence to which neither of them paid
the least attention, and their conversation was
of a purely personal nature, the kind of conversation
that has no subject and no epigrams,
and is carried on in half-finished sentences.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span></p>

<p>"I am beginning to understand why you
don't paint or write or do things, although you
know such a lot about them," observed Katharine,
half closing her eyes and making a picture
of the square of sunlit garden as she saw
it framed in the woodwork of the summer-house
door.</p>

<p>Paul smiled. It was very pleasant to be told
by this child of Nature that he knew "such a
lot about things."</p>

<p>"Tell me why," was all he said, however.</p>

<p>"I think it is because it puts you in a position
to criticise every one else. It makes you
so superior, in a sort of way. Oh, bother! I
never can explain things. But don't you see,
if you were a painter yourself, you couldn't
say that there was only one painter living, as
you do now. Could you?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps I could," said Paul, and laughed
gently at her look of surprise.</p>

<p>"Of course I know you are only laughing
at me," she said in an injured tone. "You
never think I am serious about anything."</p>

<p>"My dear Miss Katharine," he assured
her, "on the contrary, I think you are most
terribly serious about everything. I have
never had so much serious conversation since
I was nineteen myself. You will have to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
grow older, before you learn to be young and
frivolous."</p>

<p>"But <i>you</i> are not frivolous," she protested.
"You know you are not. You only say that
to tease me."</p>

<p>"I only say it to convince you. It is not
my fault if you do not understand, is it?"</p>

<p>"I do understand, I am certain I do. At
least"&mdash;she paused suddenly, and looked at
him with one of her long critical looks. "Perhaps
you are right, and I don't understand you
a bit. How queer! I don't think I like the
feel of it." She ended with a little gesture of
distaste.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't bother about it, if I were
you," said Paul calmly. "You will understand
better when you are older&mdash;and younger.
Meanwhile, it is very pleasant, don't you
think?"</p>

<p>She was leaning forward with her hands
folded under her chin, and did not answer
him.</p>

<p>"What made you choose to be a barrister?"
she asked suddenly.</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Merely because it presented greater opportunities
for idleness than any other profession,
I suppose."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span></p>

<p>Katharine swung herself round on her low
stool, and looked at him incredulously.</p>

<p>"But don't you ever want to <i>do</i> anything,&mdash;you
with all your brains and your talents?"
she cried impatiently. "Surely you must have
some ambition?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," replied Paul, arranging the cushions
at the back of his head and sinking down
on them again. "I hope I shall always be
comfortable, that's all; and I have enough
money for that, thank the Lord!"</p>

<p>"Supposing you had been poor?"</p>

<p>"Don't suppose it," rejoined Paul; and her
puzzled features relaxed into a smile.</p>

<p>"I can't think why you have a face like that,
then," she said reflectively.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with my face? Does
it suggest possibilities? To think that I might
have been a minor poet all these years, without
knowing it!"</p>

<p>Katharine returned to her examination of
the flower beds; and Paul lay back, and blew
rings of smoke into the air, and watched her
through them with an amused look on his
face. He recalled some casual words of
Heaton's which had annoyed him very much
at the time,&mdash;"If I'm not in love with a
woman, I don't want to give her another
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
thought;" and he glanced at her slim waist
as she sat there, and tried lazily to analyse his
own feelings towards her.</p>

<p>"What are you thinking about?" she
asked, turning round again.</p>

<p>"About you," he said, and brought his feet
lightly to the ground and sat up and stretched
himself.</p>

<p>"What about me?" she asked curiously.</p>

<p>"I am wondering if you will miss me very
much when I am gone," he said, and slid
slowly along the chair until he sat behind her,
where he could just see her rounded profile as
she turned her face away from him.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, awfully! I wish, I do wish you
were not going!" She was looking very hard
at the flower beds now.</p>

<p>"So do I, Miss Katharine. It has been
quite delightful; I shall never forget your
sweet care of me. But you will soon forget
all about me. And besides, there is Ted."</p>

<p>"What has that got to do with it?" she
asked swiftly.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing, surely! It was merely an
inconsequent reflection on my part."</p>

<p>There was a pause for a few moments.</p>

<p>"Talk," he said suddenly, and put his hand
gently against her cheek. It warmed under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
his touch, and he heard the tremor in her voice
as she spoke.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I can't talk. Oh, please don't!"</p>

<p>"Can't you? Try."</p>

<p>She put her hand up to his, and he caught
hold of her fingers, and dropped a light kiss
on them as they lay crumpled up on his
palm. Then he pressed them slightly, and
let them go, and walked away to the house
without looking at her again. His countenance
was as unmoved as if he had just been
talking archæology to the Rector; but his
reflections seemed absorbing, and he hardly
roused himself to move aside when Ted came
lounging out of the house and ran against
him in the porch.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" said Ted. "I'm awfully sorry;
I didn't see you, really."</p>

<p>"Oh, no matter!" said Paul, who, never
being guilty of a clumsy action himself, could
afford to remain undisturbed. "Miss Katharine's
in the summer house," he added, in
answer to Ted's disconsolate look. "We've
been reading Browning. At least, Miss Katharine
out of her goodness has been trying to
make a convert of me. I am afraid I was an
unappreciative listener."</p>

<p>Ted glanced inquiringly at him. Somehow,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
it was not so easy to disapprove of Paul to his
face as it was behind his back.</p>

<p>"How poor!" he said sympathetically.
"Kitty does play so cheap, sometimes, doesn't
she? Browning is enough to give you the
hump, I should think. But she never does
that to me."</p>

<p>"Probably," said Paul, disengaging a cigarette
paper; "she would not feel the same
necessity in your case. You would have
greater facilities for conversation, I mean.
Won't you have a cigarette?"</p>

<p>Ted looked towards the shrubbery, but
lingered as though the invitation commended
itself to him.</p>

<p>"I think I'll have a pipe, if it's all the
same to you. May I try that 'baccy of yours?
Thanks, awfully!"</p>

<p>They sat down on opposite sides of the
little porch, and puffed away in silence.</p>

<p>"You haven't been over much, lately,"
observed Paul presently.</p>

<p>Ted glanced at him again, but was disarmed
by his tone of friendliness.</p>

<p>"No," he said. "At least, I was over once
or twice last week, but I never got a look in
with Kitty. I mean," he added hastily,
"she was out, or something."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah!" said Paul indifferently; "that was
unfortunate."</p>

<p>"It was a howling nuisance," said Ted, his
troubled look returning. "The truth is," he
went on, feeling a desire for a confidant to be
stronger than his distrust of Paul, "there's
something I've been trying to tell Kit for a
whole week, and for the life of me I can't get
it out."</p>

<p>"Going to make a fool of himself at the
very start," thought Paul.</p>

<p>"You see," continued Ted with an effort,
"<i>she</i> has been playing up so, lately."</p>

<p>"Your mother?" questioned Paul.</p>

<p>Ted nodded.</p>

<p>"And now she's got me a confounded
berth in some place in the city,&mdash;candles, or
grocery, or something beastly. It's the poorest
thing I ever heard. And I've got to
start on Thursday, so I must leave home to-morrow.
And Kitty doesn't know; that's
the devil, you see."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," said Paul gravely.</p>

<p>"Got it through some cousin of my father's,"
Ted went on in his aggrieved voice. "No one
but a cousin of one's father ever hears of such
rotten jobs. Said it would be the making of
me, or some rot. I've heard that before; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
men who never did a stroke of work themselves
always talk that sort of cheapness. Have
to be there at half-past eight in the morning,
too, blow it!"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," said Paul again. He began
to feel a vague interest in the boy as he sat
opposite and stretched his long legs out to
their full length, and jerked out his complaints
with the brier between his teeth.</p>

<p>"<i>She</i> thinks it such great shakes, too; just
because she won't have to keep me any longer.
She ought never to have had a son like me; I
wasn't meant for such beastly work. Why
was I born? Why was I?"</p>

<p>"The parents of the human animal are
never selected," said Paul, for the sake of saying
something.</p>

<p>"I know I'm a fool,&mdash;<i>she's</i> told me that
often enough; so I don't expect to get anything
awfully decent. But why did they
educate me as a gentleman? They should
have sent me to a board school, and then I
should have been a bounder myself, and
nothing would have mattered. What's the
use of being a gentleman and a fool? That's
what I am; and Kit's the only person in the
world who doesn't make me feel it, bless her!"</p>

<p>Paul threw away his cigarette, and made a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
sudden resolve. He was amused, in spite of
himself, at the very youthful pessimism in
Ted's remarks; and for a moment he felt
almost anxious that the boy should not spoil
his career by a false start. There was something
novel, too, in his playing the part of
counsellor, and Paul Wilton was never averse
to a new sensation. So he leaned forward and
tapped his companion on the knee with his
long, pointed forefinger.</p>

<p>"You may send me to the devil, if you
like," he said with his placid smile, "but I
should like to give you a word of advice first.
May I?"</p>

<p>Ted looked more depressed than before, but
he did not seem surprised.</p>

<p>"Fire ahead!" he said sadly. "I can stand
an awful lot. People have always given me
advice, ever since I was a kid; it's the only
thing they ever have given me."</p>

<p>"I don't suppose it is my business at all,"
said Paul, making another cigarette with the
elaborate precision he always spent on trifles;
"but I've seen so many nice chaps ruined
through a mistake in early life, and I know
one or two things, and I'm older than you,
too. Now, how do you mean to tell that child
over there that you are going away?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span></p>

<p>Ted started.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" he asked. But
his lower lip was twitching nervously, and his
colour had deepened.</p>

<p>"Well, this is what I mean. Given an
emotional creature like that, who has never
seen any man but you, and a young, impetuous
fellow like yourself, going to say good-bye to
her for an indefinite period,&mdash;well, you are
both extremely likely to arrive at one conclusion;
and my advice to you is,&mdash;Don't."</p>

<p>Ted said nothing, but continued to stare at
the tesselated floor. The elder man rose to his
feet, and restored the match box to his pocket.</p>

<p>"I nearly did it myself once," he said;
"but I didn't."</p>

<p>Ted looked him thoughtfully up and down.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't think you did," he said,
with unconscious sarcasm. Then he too rose
slowly to his feet, and stood on the doorstep
for a moment, with his hands in his pockets.
"I think you're a confounded cynical brute,"
he said rather breathlessly, "but I believe
you're right, and I won't."</p>

<p>And he walked across the lawn to the
shrubbery with the air of a man on whose
decision depends the fate of nations.</p>

<p>Paul frowned slightly, as he always did when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
he was thinking deeply, and then threw off his
preoccupation with a laugh. Even when he
was alone, he liked to preserve his attitude of
nonchalance.</p>

<p>"How have I contrived to fall among such
an appallingly serious set of infants?" he muttered.
"Hey-day! here's for London and
life!" And he turned indoors to look for a
time-table.</p>

<p>Ted stalked straight into the summer house,
with his head in the air and his mind filled
with high-souled resolutions. Any one less
occupied with his own reflections would have
seen that Katharine was sitting with an absent
look in her eyes, while the book she held in
her hand was open at the index-page. But
Ted only saw in her the woman he had just
sworn within him to respect; and he took the
book reverently out of her hand, and sat down,
also just behind her, on the end of the basket
chair. It was the same basket chair.</p>

<p>"Kitty, I say," he began, clearing his throat,
"I've come to tell you something."</p>

<p>Katharine glanced at his solemn face, and
looked away again. She wished he had not sat
just there.</p>

<p>"It must have something to do with a
funeral, then," she said, with a flippancy that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
would have aroused the suspicions of a more
observant person. But Ted was still absorbed
in his high-souled resolutions, and her abstraction
failed to make any impression on him.</p>

<p>"No, it hasn't," he rejoined gloomily. "I
wish it had! I shouldn't mind being dead, not
I! It would cure this hump, anyhow. Perhaps
some one would be sorry, then; don't
know who would, though! <i>She</i>'d only complain
of the expense of burying me."</p>

<p>"Poor old man, who has been bullying you
now?" asked Katharine, in a dreamy voice that
she strove to make interested. "Has <i>she</i> been
doing anything fresh?"</p>

<p>"Has she, that's all! She's been doing
something to some purpose, this time. Got
me a beastly job, in a beastly city place; a
pound a week; soap, or wholesale clothing, or
something poor. Says I ought to be thankful
to get anything. Thankful indeed! <i>She</i> never
shows a spark of gratitude for her bally seven
hundred a year, I know."</p>

<p>"Oh, Ted! every one is going away. What
shall I do?" The words escaped her involuntarily.
But he was still too full of his own
troubles to notice anything except that she
seemed distressed; and this, of course, was only
natural.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span></p>

<p>"I knew you'd be cut up," he said, kicking
savagely at the leg of the chair. "You're
the only chap who cares; and you'll forget
when I've been gone a week. Oh, yes, you
will! I ought never to have been born.
They're sure to be rank outsiders, too; and I
can stand anything sooner than bounders.
It's too beastly caddish for words, and I'd
like to kill him for his rotten advice. What
does he know about anything, a played-out
chap like that?"</p>

<p>Ted's conversation was apt to become involved
when he was agitated; but on this
occasion Katharine made no attempt to unravel
it.</p>

<p>"Poor Ted," she murmured tonelessly, and
continued to think about something else.</p>

<p>"I don't know why you are so cut up about
it. I'm such a rotten ass, and you're so
infernally smart! I haven't any right to expect
you to care a hang about me; I won't
even ask you to write to me, when I'm
gone," cried Ted, making desperate efforts to
keep his high-souled resolutions. "It's a
rotten, caddish world, and I'm the rottenest
fool in it."</p>

<p>He waited for the contradiction that always
came from Katharine at this point of his self-abasement;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
but when she said nothing, and
only went on staring in the opposite direction,
he felt that there was something unusually
wrong, and came hastily round to the front of
her chair and repeated his last remark with
emphasis.</p>

<p>"You may say what you like, but I am.
All the same, I would sooner chuck the whole
show than make you unhappy. I'll be hanged
if I don't go away to-morrow without a
single&mdash;" He stopped abruptly; for she
was looking up at him piteously, and his high-souled
resolutions suddenly melted into oblivion.
"Kitty, old chum, don't cry! I'm
not worth it,&mdash;on my soul I'm not; blowed
if I've ever seen you cry before! Good old
Kit, I say, don't. Oh, the devil! Do you
really mind so much?"</p>

<p>"Please, Ted, go away; you don't understand;
go away; it isn't that at all! Don't,
Ted, don't! Oh, dear, whatever made me
cry?" gasped Katharine. But Ted would
take no denial: a woman's tears would have
disarmed him, even if he had not been in love
with her; and Katharine, the tomboyish companion
of years, appeared to him in a strangely
lovable light as she sobbed into her hands and
made the feeblest efforts to keep him away.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
His arms were round her in a moment, and
her head was pulled down on his shoulder,
and he poured a medley of broken sentences
into her ear.</p>

<p>"How was I to know you cared, old chum?
Of course I have always cared; but I never
thought about it until that played-out London
chap turned up and put it into my head.
Dear old Kitty! Why, do you know, I was
half afraid you were going to like him, one
time; wasn't I a rotten ass? But, you see,
you're so bally clever, and all that; and I
supposed he was, too, and so I thought,&mdash;don't
you see? And all the while, it was me!
Buck up, Kit! I won't split that you cried, on
my honour I won't. Oh, I say, I'm the most
confoundedly lucky chap&mdash;&nbsp;But, oh, that infernal
office in the city!"</p>

<p>Katharine disengaged herself at last. His
kisses seemed to burn into her cheeks. She
pushed back the basket chair into the corner
of the summer-house, and put her fingers over
her eyes to shut out the flower beds and the
sunlight.</p>

<p>"Stop, Ted! I don't know what you mean.
You must not think those things of me; they
are simply not true. I can't let you kiss me
like that. Has the world gone suddenly mad,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
this afternoon? I don't understand what has
happened to every one. I don't understand
anything. Will you go, please, Ted? If you
won't, I&mdash;I must."</p>

<p>She forced out the disjointed sentences in
hard, passionless tones. Ted stood absolutely
still where she left him, and watched
her stumble through the doorway and disappear
among the laurel bushes and the old box-trees.
Then he rumpled up his thick hair
with both his hands, and laughed aloud.</p>

<p>"I ought never to have been born," he
said, and his voice broke.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p>On a foggy morning in the beginning of the
following January, Ted Morton strolled out
of his bedroom shortly before eight o'clock,
and rang the bell for breakfast. He yawned
as though he were only half awake, and swore
gently at the weather as he stirred up the fire
to make a blaze.</p>

<p>"What an infernal day!" he muttered, and
pulled down the blind and lighted the gas.
The housekeeper brought in his breakfast and
his letters, and wisely withdrew without saying
anything. Ted took the lid off the teapot,
and examined the three envelopes in turn.
His face brightened a little as he came to the
third, and he buttered some toast and ate it
standing.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm hanged! Not a single bill,
and one from Kit, good old Kit! That'll wait,
and that. Well, I can stand hers; it's sure
to be funny, at all events."</p>

<p>He put on one boot, and then stood up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
again and read her letter, with a large cup of
tea in his right hand. The smile on his face
faded gradually as he read, and he looked
almost thoughtful when he folded it up again
and placed it in his breast-pocket. He was
staunch in his belief that Katharine could do
no wrong, but her latest idea went far to shake
his conviction.</p>

<p>"You see, it is like this," her letter ran.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"There is plenty of money, really, but we have to
behave as though there were none; so the effect is
the same, it seems to me. I never thought about it
before; I only found it out by accident, when I overheard
Aunt Esther abusing daddy for buying some
old architectural books. It seems as though he really
does spend a good lot, without knowing it; but then,
why shouldn't he? I won't have daddy bullied, so
that I should have enough bread and butter to eat;
it is sordid and horrible. They don't say a word
about my earning my own living, but that is what
they are driving me to do; it seems ridiculous that I
should make other people uncomfortable by being here,
when there is plenty of money in the world waiting
to be earned by some one. Don't you think so?
But when I said I would come up to London and give
lessons, Aunt Esther had heroics, and said I should
kill her. She didn't say how, and I'm sure I did not
feel particularly murderous; I only wanted to laugh,
while she lay on the sofa and said I was undutiful for
trying to save her anxiety! I don't understand parents.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
They hide everything from you, and behave
as if they were wealthy; then they abuse you for
costing so much to keep; and then, when you say
you will keep yourself, they call you undutiful.
There is no doubt that if we were to send away one
of the servants, I should be able to stay at home; but
Aunt Esther would have a fit at the idea. It seems
to me that we spend half our income in trying to persuade
people of the existence of the other half. Anyhow,
I am coming up at once to look for work. I
haven't told daddy yet, and don't know how I am
going to; he will be so dreadfully cut up at losing me.
But I am sure he will understand; he is the one person
who always has understood. And won't it be
glorious when I have earned enough money to give
him everything he wants? About rooms: I saw an
advertisement of some, a few doors from you. Do
you know them? I thought it would be rather nice
to be near you," etc., etc.</p>
</div>

<p>Ted answered her letter the same evening.
Writing letters was always a labour to
him, but he toiled over this one more than
usual.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"Of course you know what you are playing at,"
he wrote, "but I believe it is awfully hard to get anything
to do. London is packed with people trying to
find work; and most of them don't find it. As to
the rooms, it would be beastly jolly to have you so
close, but I don't advise your coming here; this
street pals on to Regent Street, you know, and it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
isn't supposed to be pleasant for a girl. I will explain
more fully when I see you. Let me know if I can
do anything for you. I'm a rotten ass at expressing
myself, as you know; but it will be awfully decent
to have you to take about. Only I don't like the
idea of your grinding away alone; it's rotten enough
for a man, but it's miles worse for a woman. Write
again soon. It <i>is</i> a life, isn't it?"</p>
</div>

<p>It was nearly a fortnight before he heard
from her again, and he felt guiltily conscious
of not having encouraged her as much as she
expected. Then came another letter, in her
small, firm handwriting; and he tore it open
anxiously.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"I am coming up by the 4.55 on Wednesday,"
she wrote. "Will you meet me? I thought perhaps
you might, as it is a late train. Oh, Ted, I
feel so old and different somehow; I don't believe
I <i>could</i> climb into that pantry window now! Daddy
took it so strangely; he hardly said anything at all.
Do you think it is possible that he really does not
love me as much as I love him? And I mind leaving
him so much that it quite hurts every time he
asks me to do anything for him. Why was I made
to like people more than they like me? Why, I
believe daddy was rather relieved than otherwise.
And I thought he would never be able to do without
me! Am I very conceited, I wonder? But indeed,
I do believe he will miss me dreadfully when I am
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
gone. Aunt Esther won't speak to me at all; I
feel in disgrace, without having done anything wrong.
Parents are inexplicable; they seem to grow tired
of us as we grow up, just like birds! And they
persist in treating us like children, while they are
forcing us to behave as if we were grown up; I
can't understand them, or anything. Things seem
to be going all wrong, everywhere. I have heard
of a sort of home for working gentlewomen, near
Edgware Road; it seems respectable, and it is certainly
cheap. They have left me to arrange everything,
just as though I were going to do something
wicked. And I thought all the while I was doing
something so splendid and heroic! You will meet
me, won't you? I feel so forlorn and miserable."</p>
</div>
<p>Ted wrote back immediately:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"It is a beastly rotten world. Neither of us
ought to have been born. I will cut the office and
meet you. Buck up."</p>
</div>

<p>And the following Wednesday saw him on
the platform at Euston, trying to find Katharine
in the crowd of passengers who were
pouring out of the 4.55 train. It was not long
before he discovered her, looking very unlike
her surroundings, and pointing out her luggage,
half apologetically, to a porter who seemed
inclined to patronise her. There was an exaggerated
air of self-possession in her bearing,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
which did not conceal her provincial look and
rather showed that she felt less composed than
she wished to appear. Ted examined her for
a moment doubtfully, and then made his way
towards her. He had not seen her once since
she left him in the summer-house, eight
months ago; and he was amazed at himself
for not feeling more disturbed at meeting her
again now. Perhaps her prosaic winter clothing
helped to rob the occasion of romance;
for, in his mind, he had vaguely expected to
find her wearing the garden hat and print
frock in which he had last seen her. But
when she turned round and saw him, the frank
pleasure in her face was the same as it had
always been, and the episode that had been
enacted in the summer-house seemed all at
once to be blotted out of their past.</p>

<p>"You dear old boy, I knew you'd come!
I feel so awfully out of it, in this noise! Do
make that porter understand I want to get
across to Gower Street, will you? He seems
confused. I don't speak a different language,
do I? Just look at that glorious pair of bays;
but, oh, what a shame to give them bearing-reins!
Why, Ted, what a swell you are in
that frock coat; you look just like the vet. at
Stoke on Sundays! Oh, I'm so sorry; I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
forgot! I want to get to Edgware Road, you
see, and I thought&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, we'll cab it, then! Nonsense! it isn't
a bit cheaper, only nastier. Girls never understand
these things. Hadn't you better get
in, instead of examining the points of the
horse? It won't stand any quieter than that,
if that's your idea."</p>

<p>The porter went off with a handsome gratuity,
and Katharine settled herself in her
corner of the cab, and began to examine her
companion.</p>

<p>"You've altered a little bit, Ted," she observed.
"You're not so afraid of unimportant
people as you used to be. I believe you would
go into the post office at Stoke for your own
stamps, now, instead of sending me because
the girl laughed at you. Do you remember?
You are such a swell, too; how you must be
getting on at that place!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't think so. I don't want to
get on there; no decent chap would," said
Ted, and Katharine changed the conversation.</p>

<p>"The streets seem very full," she said, as
they came to a block in the traffic.</p>

<p>"Up to the brim," said Ted laconically.
"I always wonder the horses don't tread on
one another's toes, don't you?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span></p>

<p>She laughed in her old joyous manner,
and he leaned back contentedly and looked at
her.</p>

<p>"At all events, you haven't altered much,"
he observed.</p>

<p>"I've grown an inch, and my dresses are
quite long now. Besides, I have put up my
hair. Didn't you notice?"</p>

<p>"I thought there was something. Turn
your head round. About time you did, wasn't
it? But why don't you make it stick out
more? Other girls do, don't they?"</p>

<p>Katharine had not seen any other girls, and
said so; whereupon Ted supposed it was all
right, if she thought it was, and added conciliatingly,
that at all events her new coat was
"all there." They chattered in the same trivial
manner all the rest of the way; it was like
the old days, when they had never thought
of making up a quarrel formally, but had
just resumed matters where they had been
broken off.</p>

<p>"Do you feel bad?" he asked, in his sympathetic
way, when they stood at last on the
well-worn doorstep of number ten, Queen's
Crescent, Marylebone.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know! I've got to go through
with it now, haven't I? It's just like you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
and me not to have touched on anything
really important all the way; isn't it? And
I've got such a heap of things to tell you,"
said Katharine, in a nervous tone; and she
gave a little shiver as an east wind came
rushing up the street and blew dirty pieces of
paper against the dingy iron railings, whence
they fluttered down into the area.</p>

<p>"Never mind; I'll look you up some
evening soon. Let me know if you want bucking
up or anything. Good-bye, old chum."</p>

<p>And she found herself inside a dimly lighted,
distempered hall, face to face with a kindly
looking maid, who was greeting her with the
air of conventional welcome she had been
told to assume towards strangers. It was
supposed to support the advertisement that
this was a home.</p>

<p>"Miss Jennings? No, miss; she won't be
in, not before supper. And the lady what's
in your cubicle ain't cleared out yet, miss, so
I can't take your box up, neither. Will you
come and have your tea, miss? This way, if
you please."</p>

<p>Katharine followed her mechanically. The
heroic notions that had sustained her for weeks
were vanishing before this pleasant-faced maid
and the dreary, distempered hall. For the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
first time in her life a feeling of shyness suddenly
overwhelmed her, as the servant held
open a door, and a hum of voices and clatter
of plates came out into the passage. For
the moment, she hardly knew where to look
or what to do. The room into which she
had been ushered was a bare-looking one,
though clean enough, and better lighted than
the hall outside. Long tables were placed
across it, and around these, on wooden chairs,
sat some twenty or thirty girls of various ages,
some of whom were talking and others reading,
as they occupied themselves with their
tea. They all looked up when Katharine
came into the room, but the spectacle did not
present enough novelty to interest them long,
and they soon looked away again and went on
with their several occupations. "<i>She</i> won't
be here long,&mdash;not the sort," Katharine overheard
one of them saying to another, and the
casual remark brought the colour to her
cheeks, and made her assume desperately some
show of courage.</p>

<p>"May I take this chair?" she asked, moving
towards a vacant place as she spoke.</p>

<p>"It isn't anybody's; none of them are
unless the plate is turned upside down," volunteered
the girl in the next chair. She was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
reading "Pitman's Phonetic Journal," and
eating bread and treacle.</p>

<p>"You have to get your own tea from the
urn over there, and collect your food from all
the other tables," she added in the same
brusque manner, as Katharine sat down and
looked helplessly about her. However, by
following out the instructions thus thrown at
her, she managed, with a little difficulty, to
procure what she wanted from the food that
was scattered incidentally about the room,
and then returned to her seat by the girl who
was eating bread and treacle.</p>

<p>"Isn't it rather late for tea?" she asked of
her neighbour, who at least seemed friendly in
a raw sort of way.</p>

<p>"It always goes on till seven; most of them
don't get back from the office before this,
you see."</p>

<p>"What office?" asked Katharine, who did
not see.</p>

<p>"Any office," returned the girl, staring round
at her. "Post office generally, or a place in
the city, or something like that. Some of them
are shorthand clerks, like me,&mdash;it's shorter
hours and better paid as a rule; but it's getting
overcrowded, like everything else."</p>

<p>"Do you like it?" asked Katharine. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
girl stared again. The possibility of liking one's
work had never occurred to her before.</p>

<p>"Of course not; but we have to grin and
bear it, like the food here and everything else.
I'm sorry for you if you mean to stop here
long; you don't look as though you could
stand it. I've seen your sort before, and they
never stop long."</p>

<p>"Oh, I mean to stop," said Katharine decidedly.
But her heroic mood had been
completely dissipated by the leaden atmosphere
of the place, and she could not repress
a sigh.</p>

<p>"Butter bad?" asked her neighbour cheerfully.
"Try the treacle; it's safer. You
can't go far wrong with treacle. The jam's
always suspicious; you find plum stones in
the strawberries, and so on."</p>

<p>Katharine was obliged to laugh, and the
shorthand clerk, who had not meant to make
a joke, seemed hurt.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," said Katharine, "but
your cynical view of the food is so awfully
funny."</p>

<p>"Wait till you've been here three years,
like I have," said the shorthand clerk, and
she returned to her newspaper.</p>

<p>Katharine tried to stay the sinking at her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
heart, and made a critical review of the room.
What impressed her most was the twang of
the girls' voices. Not that they were noisy,&mdash;for
they seemed a quiet set on the whole;
either daily routine or respectability had succeeded
in subduing their spirits; but for all
that they did not look unhappy, and Katharine
supposed, as her neighbour had remarked,
that it was possible to get used to it after
a time.</p>

<p>"And the room is certainly clean," she reflected,
as she made an effort to see the brighter
side of things; "and the girls don't stare,
or ask questions, or do anything unpleasant.
I <i>couldn't</i> tell them anything about myself
if they did. And I do wish, though I know
it's awfully snobbish, that some of them were
ladies."</p>

<p>Her neighbour broke in upon her thoughts,
and Katharine came to herself with a start.</p>

<p>"Whose cuby are you going to have?"
she was asking.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't know. The servant said it
was not empty yet. I should rather like to
unpack."</p>

<p>"I don't suppose you will get a permanent
one yet awhile," said the shorthand clerk, in
the cheerful way with which she imparted all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
her unpleasant revelations; "they always move
you about for a week or two first. I expect
you are coming into our room for the
present; Miss King is going up to Scotland
by the night mail. Jenny will tell you when
she comes in. Supper is at nine," she added,
pushing back her chair and folding up her
paper, "and there are two reception rooms
upstairs, if you want to sit somewhere till
your cubicle is empty."</p>

<p>Katharine thanked her, and felt more forlorn
than ever when the shorthand clerk had
gone. But the servant came to her rescue a
few minutes later, and offered to take her to
her room which was now empty.</p>

<p>"Is it Miss King's?" asked Katharine, and
felt a little happier when she learned that it
was. She would have one acquaintance in
the same room at all events. But her heart
sank again, when she found herself alone with
her two boxes in a curtained corner of a
dingy room, the corner that was the farthest
from the window and the smallest of the four
compartments. There was hardly room to
move; and when she tried to unpack her boxes,
she found that most of the drawers in the
tiny chest were already occupied, and that
there were no pegs for her dresses.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span></p>

<p>"Could anything be more dreary?" she
said aloud. "And the curtains are just horribly
dirty, and I don't feel as though I <i>could</i>
get into that bed. And what a tiny jug
and basin!"</p>

<p>"Hullo, is that you?" said the voice of the
shorthand clerk, who had come into her part
of the room unobserved. "I guessed you'd
feel pretty bad when you saw what it was like.
They all do. But you might as well turn up
the gas, and make it as cheerful as possible.
That's better. Well, it's not much like the
prospectus, is it?"</p>

<p>Katharine remembered the plausible statements
of the prospectus, and broke into a
laugh. There was a grim humour in her
situation that appealed to her, though it
seemed to be lost on her companion.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm glad you can laugh, though I
never found it funny myself," she called out.
"But don't stay moping here; come into the
drawing-room until the bell rings for supper,
won't you?"</p>

<p>Katharine followed her advice, and allowed
herself to be taken into another bare looking
room, over the dining-room. This was furnished
with a horsehair sofa and three basket
chairs, which were all occupied, several cane
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
chairs, and two square tables, at which some
girls sat writing. One of them looked up as
the door opened, and asked the shorthand clerk
to come and help her with her arithmetic.</p>

<p>"You know I'm no good, Polly. Where's
Miss Browne?" asked the shorthand clerk,
pushing a chair towards Katharine, and taking
one herself.</p>

<p>"She's out; I think you might try," said
the girl who had spoken to her, in a peevish
tone. "I have got to finish this paper to-night;
and I'm fagged now."</p>

<p>"Can I help?" asked Katharine. The other
two looked at her, and seemed surprised.</p>

<p>"This is some one new," explained her first
friend. "Let me introduce you: Miss Polly
Newland, Miss&mdash;&nbsp;Why, I don't even know
your name, do I?"</p>

<p>"Austen," said Katharine. "Won't you
tell me yours?"</p>

<p>The girl said her name was Hyam,&mdash;Phyllis
Hyam; and they returned to the subject of
the arithmetic.</p>

<p>"Let's look at it, Polly," said Phyllis
Hyam, and Miss Newland passed the paper
across the table. The two girls bent over it,
and Phyllis shook her head.</p>

<p>"I never understood stocks,&mdash;too badly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
taught!" she said, and tilted her chair and began
to whistle.</p>

<p>"Shall I try?" said Katharine, taking out a
pencil. She worked out the sum to the
satisfaction of Polly Newland, who then unbent
a little, and explained that she was going
up for the Civil Service examination in
March.</p>

<p>"I say, you're clever, aren't you? Do
you teach?" asked Phyllis Hyam, bringing
the front legs of her chair down again with
a bang.</p>

<p>"That is what I want to do; but I never
have," replied Katharine. The other two
looked at her pityingly.</p>

<p>"Any friends in London?" they asked.</p>

<p>"Only relations; and they won't help me."</p>

<p>"Of course not. Relations never do. Hope
you'll get some work," said the shorthand clerk
dubiously. Katharine changed the conversation,
to hide her own growing apprehension.</p>

<p>"Where are the newspapers?" she asked,
looking round.</p>

<p>"In the prospectus; never saw them anywhere
else!" said Phyllis, with a short
laugh.</p>

<p>"Did you expect to find any?" asked Polly
Newland. "They all do," she added gravely.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
"It's like the baths, and the boots, and everything
else."</p>

<p>"Surely, the bath-room is not a fallacy?"
exclaimed Katharine in dismay.</p>

<p>"Oh, there is one down in the basement;
but all the water has to be boiled for it, so
only three people can have a bath every evening.
You have to put your name down in a
book; and your turn comes in about a fortnight."</p>

<p>"And the boots?" said Katharine, suppressing
a sigh.</p>

<p>"You have to clean your own, that's all.
They are supposed to provide the blacking and
the brushes; but, my eye, what brushes! Of
course you get used to it after a bit. When
you get to your worst, you will probably wear
them dirty."</p>

<p>"When does one get to one's worst?" asked
Katharine.</p>

<p>"That depends," said Polly Newland, sucking
the end of her pencil, and staring across in
a curious manner at Katharine. "I should say
you would get to it pretty soon, if you stop
long enough."</p>

<p>"Of course I shall stop!" cried Katharine,
a little impatiently. "Why do you both say
that?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span></p>

<p>The two girls glanced at one another.</p>

<p>"You're not the sort," said Phyllis shortly;
and Polly returned to her arithmetic.</p>

<p>Katharine relapsed into a dream. All her
aspirations, all her hopes of making her father
a rich man, had only landed her in number
ten, Queen's Crescent, Marylebone! She
looked round at the silent occupants of the
room,&mdash;some of them too tired to do anything
but lounge about, some of them reading novelettes,
some of them mending stockings. She
wondered if her existence would simply become
like theirs,&mdash;a daily routine, with just enough
money to support life, and not enough to buy
its pleasures; enough energy to get through
its toil, and not enough to enjoy its leisure.
Ivingdon, with its recent troubles, its more distant
happiness, seemed separated from this rude
moment of disillusionment by a long stretch of
years. A passionate instinct of rebellion against
the circumstances that were answerable for her
present situation made her unhappiness seem
still more pitiable to her; and a tragic picture
of herself, martyred and forgotten, ten years
hence, brought sympathetic tears to her own
eyes.</p>

<p>A piano began a cheerful accompaniment in
the next room, and some one sang a ballad in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
a fresh, untrained soprano. The piano was out
of tune, and the song was of the cheapest and
most popular nature; but it made an interruption
in the sound of the traffic outside on
the cobble-stones, and Katharine glanced round
the room characteristically, in search of an
answering smile. But the other girls were as
unaffected by the music as they had been by
the dreariness that preceded it; and nobody
looked up from what she was doing. Only
one of them made a comment; it was Phyllis
Hyam. "How that girl does thump!" she
said.</p>

<p>But on Katharine the effect had been instantaneous.
She was not cultured in music: with
her it was an emotion, not an art; and the
little jingling tune had already turned her
thoughts into a happier channel. Her spirits
rose insensibly, and the spell that the dingy
surroundings had cast over her was broken.
Why should she believe what these two girls
told her? Surely, her conviction that she
would make something of her life was not going
to wear itself out in a miserable struggle to
keep alive! She was worth something more
than that: she was intellectual beyond her years;
every one had told her so, until she had come
to believe it was true; and her future was in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
her own hands. She would be a teacher of a
new school; she would make a name for herself
by her lectures; and then, some day, when she
had acquired a fortune, and all the world was
talking of her talent, and her goodness, and her
beauty,&mdash;she was going to be very beautiful,
too, in her dream,&mdash;these girls would remember
that they had doubted her powers of endurance.
She was even rehearsing what she would
say to them in the hour of her triumph, when
a touch on her shoulder brought her back
abruptly to her present surroundings, and she
looked up to see a little white-haired lady at
her side, in a lace cap and a black silk apron.</p>

<p>"Miss Austen? Come down with me, and
let us have a little chat together. I was sorry
not to be back in time to receive you, my
dear."</p>

<p>It was a sudden awakening; but she was able
to smile as she followed her guide downstairs.</p>

<p>"She has the captivating manner of an
impostor," she reflected. "She is just like
Widow Priest! But it accounts for the
prospectus."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p>The next day, she began a vigorous search for
work. She did everything that is generally
done by women who come up from the country
and expect to find employment waiting for
them; she answered advertisements, she visited
agents, she walked over the length and breadth
of London, she neglected no opportunity that
seemed to offer possibilities. But she soon
found that she had much to learn. She discovered
that she was not the only girl in London,
who thought there was a future before
her because she was more intellectually minded
than the rest of her family; and she found that
every agent's office was full of women, with
more experience than herself, who had also
passed the Higher Local Examination with
honours, and did not think very much of it.
And she had to learn that an apologetic manner
is not the best one to assume towards strangers,
and that omnibus conductors do not mean to
be patronising when they say "missy," and
that a policeman is always open to the flattery
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
of being addressed as "Constable." But what
she did not learn was the extravagance of being
economical; and it was some time yet before
she discovered that walking until she was over-tired,
and fasting until she could not eat, were
the two most expensive things she could have
done.</p>

<p>But she found no work. Either there was
none to be had, or she was too young; or, as
they sometimes implied, too attractive. When
this last objection was made to her by the
elderly principal of a girl's school, Katharine
stared in complete bewilderment for a moment
or two, and then broke into an incredulous
laugh.</p>

<p>"But, surely, my looking young and&mdash;and
inexperienced would not affect my powers of
teaching," she remonstrated.</p>

<p>"It would prevent my taking you," replied
the principal coldly. "I must have some one
about me whom I can trust, and leave safely
with the children. Besides, what do I know
of your capabilities? You say you have never
even tried to teach?"</p>

<p>"But I know I can teach,&mdash;I am certain of it;
I only want a chance. Why must I wait until
I am old and unsympathetic, and can no
longer feel in touch with the children, before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
any one will trust me with a class? It is not
reasonable."</p>

<p>The elderly principal remained unmoved.</p>

<p>"The teaching market is overcrowded by
such as you," she said. "I should advise your
trying something else."</p>

<p>"I have not been trained to anything else,"
said Katharine. "That is where it is so hard.
I might have got a secretaryship, if I had
known shorthand. I never knew I should
have to earn my own living, or I should be
better qualified to do it. But I know I can
teach, if I get the chance."</p>

<p>"Are you compelled to earn your living?"
asked the principal, a little less indifferently.
"Pardon me, but I have heard your tale so
often before from girls who might, with a little
forbearance, have remained at home."</p>

<p>"I am compelled," answered Katharine.
"At least&mdash;"</p>

<p>A feeling of loyalty to her father, her lovable,
faulty old father, who was so unconscious
of her present difficulties, kept her silent and
brought a troubled look into her face. The
elderly principal was not unkindly, when circumstances
did not force her to be academic;
and Katharine, when she looked troubled, was
very attractive indeed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span></p>

<p>"My dear," she said, with a severity that
she assumed in order to justify her weakness in
her own mind, "what are your friends thinking
of? Go home; it is the right place for a
child like you."</p>

<p>Katharine hurried away to conceal her desire
to laugh. She did not go home, however;
she went to a cheap milliner's in the Edgware
Road, and ordered them to make her a
severely simple bonnet. And when it came
home the next evening, and she put it on, she
hardly knew whether to laugh or to cry at the
reflection of herself in the glass. "Whatever
would daddy say?" she thought, and put it
hastily back into the box; and if the other
occupants of her room had happened to come
in just then, they would certainly have modified
their opinion of her pride and her coldness.
But, after all, she was no better off than before;
for the contrast of youth and age that
her new bonnet made in her appearance was
rather conspicuous than otherwise, and she
found that her old countrified hat suited her
purpose far better.</p>

<p>She saw very little of Ted at this time. He
asked her to come out with him, once or
twice, but she always refused. She was afraid
that he would ask questions, and she shrank
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
from telling any one, even Ted, of her failure
to get on. On the few occasions that she
went down to speak to him in the hall, she told
him that she was getting along quite well, and
would be sure to hear of some work very soon,
and that she would prefer not to come out
with him because it unsettled her. And Ted,
in his humble-minded way, thought she had
made new friends in the house and did not
care to be bothered with him; and Katharine,
who read him like a book, knew that he
thought so, and made fresh efforts to get on
so that she could spend all her leisure time
with him. She wrote home in the same spirit,
and said that she was sure of making her way
soon, and that, meanwhile, she had everything
she wanted, and nobody was to be anxious
about her. And her father, with the quaint
unworldliness of his nature, wrote back that he
was glad to hear she was happy, and that he
had no doubt the ten pounds he had given her
would last until she earned some more, and
that he had just picked up a perfect bargain in
an old book shop for thirty shillings.</p>

<p>"Dear daddy," smiled Katharine, without a
trace of bitterness. "Could any one be more
economical for other people, and more extravagant
for himself? I wonder if that is what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
makes me love him so? But, oh, what would
I give for that thirty shillings!"</p>

<p>She counted her little store for the twentieth
time, and sat thinking. Doubtless she had
spent her money injudiciously at first; but the
fact remained that, if she went on at her present
rate of expenditure, she would have to return
home in a fortnight. If she went without her
midday meal, and economised in every possible
way, she might manage to remain another
month.</p>

<p>"That is what I must do," she said. "That
will bring me to the middle of March, and I
shall have been in London just nine weeks.
And, after all, the food is so nasty that I sha'n't
mind much. Besides, it is really very romantic
to starve a little."</p>

<p>It grew less romantic as another fortnight
went by. The food had never seemed less nasty
than it did now; and she had to take long
walks at dinner time to escape the appetising
smell of the hot dishes. She had never realised
before what a very healthy appetite she
possessed; and she remembered with some
regret how she had been too dainty, at first,
to touch the food at all, and had lived for days
almost entirely on bread and butter. But now
she would have eaten any of it with a relish,&mdash;even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
a certain dish which was said to be stewed
rabbit, but which she had derisively termed
"a cat in a pie dish."</p>

<p>One day, she read an alluring advertisement
of a new agency. She had lost her faith in
agencies, and she had no more money for fees;
but at least it was an object for a walk, and
anything was better than waiting indoors for
something to happen. To be idle in a place
like Queen's Crescent was not an enviable
position. And by this time she knew her
London pretty well, and it fascinated her, and
spoke to her of life, and work, and the future;
and a walk through any part of it was always
exhilarating. As she turned into the park at
the Marble Arch, a carriage and pair rumbled
out with two well-dressed women in it. Katharine
stopped and looked after it, with an
amused smile on her face.</p>

<p>"My aunt and cousin," she murmured aloud.
"What would they say, if they knew? And
once they came to stay with us, and they
worried daddy no end, and said I wanted finishing,
and ought to go to Paris! It seems to
me that life is always a comedy, but sometimes
it drops into a roaring farce!"</p>

<p>And pleased with the appositeness of her own
remark, she continued her walk in better spirits
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
than her worldly condition would seem to
justify. The agency turned out to be on the
top floor of some flats near Parliament Street;
and the porter looked curiously at her as he
took her up in the lift.</p>

<p>"Agency, miss? So they says, I'm told.
Don't believe in agencies much myself, I
don't; queerish kind of impostory places, I
calls 'em. Don't you let yourself be took in,
missy!"</p>

<p>Katharine remembered the condition of her
purse, and felt that it was not likely. Her
destination was marked by a large amount of
information on the wall, headed by the inscription,
"Parker's Universal Scholastic and Commercial
Agency." She had not much time to
study it, however, for an office boy hastened
to answer her knock, as though he had been
longing for the opportunity to do so for some
time, and said that Mr. Parker was at liberty,
if she would kindly step in. She fancied that
he also stared critically at her, and she began
to fear that something was wrong with her
personal appearance. This naturally did not
add to her self-possession; and when she found
herself in a small inner room that smelt of stale
tobacco and whiskey, she began to wish she
had not come at all. A fair-haired man, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
a moustache and an eyeglass, was sitting with
his feet on the mantel-shelf when she entered
the room; but he jumped up with a great deal
of fuss, and offered her a chair, and asked her
what he could do for her. Katharine faltered
out her usual inquiry for teaching work; and
the fact that Mr. Parker was adjusting his eyeglass
and taking her in from head to foot all
the time, completed her discomfiture.</p>

<p>"Teaching? To be sure," he said with a
supercilious smile, and went at once to the
door and told the boy to bring the books.</p>

<p>"There ain't no books, and you knows it,"
retorted the boy, who seemed disposed to be
rebellious; and Mr. Parker vanished precipitately
into the other room. When he returned,
his smile was unaltered; and he sat down
again, and twirled his drooping moustache.</p>

<p>"I have just looked through the books," he
said, "and don't see anything good enough
for you. Would you care to take anything
else?"</p>

<p>"I don't quite know what else I could do,"
said Katharine doubtfully. She wanted to
get away, and did not exactly know how to
make a dignified exit.</p>

<p>"Book-keeping, for instance, or literary
work? Have you ever tried being a secretary?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
Ah, I am sure you have! You are
not the sort of young lady to lead the life of
a humdrum governess, eh?"</p>

<p>"I was my father's secretary," said Katharine.
Mr. Parker was leaning across the table
and playing with the pens in the ink-stand, so
that his hand almost touched her elbow.</p>

<p>"Of course you were. So I was right about
you, wasn't I? Don't you think that was very
clever of me, now?"</p>

<p>He leaned a little nearer to her, and Katharine
drew back instinctively and took her
elbow off the table. He found the straight
look of her eyes a little disconcerting, and
left off playing with the penholders.</p>

<p>"Speaking seriously," he said, donning an
official air with alacrity, "would you care to
take a post as secretary?"</p>

<p>He had dropped his eyeglass and his supercilious
manner, and Katharine took courage.</p>

<p>"I should, immensely. But they are so
hard to get."</p>

<p>"Of course they are not easy to pick up,
but in an agency like ours we often hear of
something good. Let me see, would you like
to go out to South Africa? Hardly, I should
think."</p>

<p>Katharine said she would not like to go out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
to South Africa; whereupon Mr. Parker offered
New Zealand as an alternative.</p>

<p>"Your connection seems to lie principally
in other quarters of the globe," Katharine felt
obliged to remark; and in an unguarded moment
she began to laugh at the absurdity of his
suggestions. Mr. Parker at once ceased to
look official, and laughed with her, and began
playing with the pens in the inkstand again.</p>

<p>"Ah, now we understand each other better,"
he said, resuming his familiar tone. "What
you want is a snug little berth with some literary
boss, who won't give you too much to do,
eh? A nice salary, and some one charming to
play with; isn't that it?"</p>

<p>The sheer vulgarity of the man exposed
the real nature of the situation to her. Her
first impulse was to rush out of his sight, at
any cost; but she restrained herself with an
effort, and drew a sharp breath to gain time to
collect her resources.</p>

<p>"I am afraid, Mr. Parker, that we don't understand
each other at all," she said very
slowly, trying to conceal the tremble in her
voice; "and as I don't feel inclined to emigrate,
I think I had better&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now, now, what a hurry you are in, to be
sure!" interrupted Mr. Parker, getting up and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
lounging round to her side of the table. "You
haven't even heard what I was going to say.
I've been looking out for a secretary myself,
for some time, 'pon my oath I have; but never,
until this blessed moment, have I set eyes upon
a young lady who suited me so well as you.
Now, what do you say to that, eh?"</p>

<p>Katharine had risen, too, and was turning
imperceptibly towards the door. She glanced
contemptuously round the room, that was so
entirely devoid of the ordinary apparatus of
business, and she walked swiftly to the door
and opened it, before he had time to prevent
her.</p>

<p>"You are most kind," she said sarcastically,
emboldened by the presence of the office boy,
"but I feel that the work would be very much
too hard for me. A large business like yours
must need so much looking after! Good
morning."</p>

<p>Outside, while she was waiting for the lift,
her composure completely deserted her, and she
found she was trembling all over, and had to
lean against the balusters for support.</p>

<p>"I knowed you wasn't the sort to go a-mixing
of yourself up with that kidney," observed
the porter, who detected the tears in her
eyes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span></p>

<p>"Why didn't you tell me he was such a
horrid man?" asked Katharine. She was
thoroughly unnerved, and even the porter's
sympathy was better than none at all.</p>

<p>"It wasn't my business to hinterfere," said
the porter, who was merely curious and not
sympathetic at all; and Katharine dried her
eyes hastily, and tried to laugh.</p>

<p>"Of course it is nobody's business," she
said drearily, and gave him twopence for helping
her to realise the fact. "And I shouldn't
have cried at all, if I had had any lunch," she
added vehemently to herself.</p>

<p>Some one was waiting to enter the lift as she
stepped out of it. She looked up by chance
and caught his eye, and they uttered each
other's name in the same breath.</p>

<p>For a moment they stood silent, as they
loosed hands again. Katharine had blushed,
hopelessly and irretrievably; but he was standing
a little away from her, with just the necessary
amount of interest in his look, and the
necessary amount of pleasure in his smile.
Paul was a man who prided himself on never
straining a situation; and directly he saw her
agitation at meeting him, he assumed the
conventional attitude, entirely for purposes of
convenience.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span></p>

<p>"This is very delightful. Are you staying
in town?"</p>

<p>"Yes. At least&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your father well, I hope? And Miss
Esther? I am charmed to hear it. Supposing
we move out of the draught; yes, cold,
isn't it? Thanks, I won't go up now&mdash;"
this to the porter, who was still waiting by the
lift. "Which way are you going? Good! I
have a call to pay in Gloucester Place, and we
might go in the same cab."</p>

<p>It was pleasant to be ordered about, after
taking care of herself for seven weeks, and
Katharine yielded at once to the masterful
tone, which had always compelled her compliance
from the moment she had first heard it.</p>

<p>"Now, please, I want to hear all about it,"
he began briskly, as they drove westwards.
His manner was no longer conventional, and
his familiar voice carried her back over the
weary months of last year to the spring when
she had still been a child. Somehow she did
not feel, as with Ted, that she could not tell
him about her failures: it seemed as though
this man must know all there was to know
about her, whether it was pleasant for him to
hear it or not; though, as she told him about
her coming to town and her subsequent career
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
there, she made her tale so entertaining that
Paul was something more than idly amused,
when she finally brought it to an end.</p>

<p>"Do you think I ought not to have done
it?" she asked him, anxiously, as he did not
speak. He looked at her before he answered.</p>

<p>"I cannot imagine how they let you do it!"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't! That is what that horrid old
lady principal said. What could possibly happen
to me, I should like to know?"</p>

<p>He looked at her again, with his provoking
serenity.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing, of course! At least, not to
you."</p>

<p>"Why not to me, particularly?" she asked
half petulantly. She did not know whether to
be pleased or annoyed that he should credit her
with the same infallible quality as every one else.</p>

<p>"Because things of that nature do not, I
believe, happen to girls of your nature. But
of course I may be wrong; I am quite ignorant
in these matters."</p>

<p>She smiled at his show of humility; it was so
characteristic of him to affect indifference about
his own opinions. But she had learnt something
already that day, and she remembered
Mr. Parker, and thought that Paul very possibly
was wrong on this occasion.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span></p>

<p>"Every one tells me that. I can't see how
I am different," she said thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't worry about it, if I were you.
You could not be expected to see. But it is
just that little difference that has probably
carried you through."</p>

<p>Katharine remembered Mr. Parker again,
and laughed outright.</p>

<p>"I don't think so," she said. "I think it is
more likely to have been my sense of humour."</p>

<p>"You used to laugh like that when I first
knew you," he said involuntarily. She knew
that he had spoken without reflection, and she
laughed again with pleasure. It was always a
triumph to surprise him into spontaneity.</p>

<p>"How jolly it was in those days! Do you
remember our tea in the orchard, how we
watched Aunt Esther out of the front door,
and then brought the things out through the
back door?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and how you spilt the milk, and
cook wouldn't let you have any more, and
our second cups were spoilt?"</p>

<p>"Rather! And how you shocked Dorcas&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah," sighed Paul; "we can never do those
delightful things again. We know one another
too well, now."</p>

<p>They allowed themselves to become almost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
depressed, for the space of a moment, because
they knew one another so well. "All the
same," observed Katharine, "there is still one
joy left to us. We can quarrel."</p>

<p>He became conventional again as he rang
the bell for her at number ten, Queen's Crescent,
Marylebone. He raised his hat, and
gently pressed her hand, and supposed he
should see her again soon. And Katharine,
who was occupied in hoping that he did not
notice the squalor of the area, and would not
come inside the dull, distempered hall, only
said that she supposed so too; and then
blamed herself hotly, as he drove away, for
not responding more warmly.</p>

<p>"He will think I don't want to see him
again," she thought wearily, as she dragged
herself up the uncarpeted stairs, and went into
her dark and dingy cubicle. It had never
seemed so dark or so dingy before; and she
added miserably to herself, "I had better not
see him again, perhaps. It makes it all so
much worse afterwards."</p>

<p>She would have been surprised had she
known what Paul really was thinking about
her.</p>

<p>"She is more of a study than ever," he
said to the cab horse. "Still so much of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
innocent pose about her, with just that indication
of added knowledge that is so fascinating
to a man. She'll do, now she has got away
from her depressing relations; and the touch
of weirdness in her expression is an improvement.
Wonder if Heaton would call her a
schoolgirl now? It was quite finished, the
careless way she said good-bye, as though it
were of no consequence to her at all. Yes;
she is a study."</p>

<p>About a week later, when Katharine came
down to breakfast, Phyllis Hyam threw her
a letter, in her unceremonious fashion.</p>

<p>"Look here!" she said. "I've kept you
a chair next to mine, and I've managed to
procure you a clean plate, too; so don't go
away to the other table, as you did yesterday.
Polly's gone; and I won't talk unless you
want to. Come on!"</p>

<p>Katharine sat down absently on the hard
wooden chair, and began to read her letter.
She never wanted to talk at breakfast time,
a fact which Phyllis good-naturedly recognised
without respecting. To-day she was more
silent than usual.</p>

<p>"No, I can't eat any of that stuff," she said
to the proffered bacon. "Get me some tea, will
you? I'll make myself some toast."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span></p>

<p>Phyllis trotted off to the fire instead, and
made it herself; and Katharine returned to
her letter without noticing her further. Judging
from the tense look on her face, it was of
more than ordinary interest.</p>

<p>"Dear Miss Katharine," it ran,</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>A school in which I have a little influence is in
want of a junior mistress. I have no idea as to the
kind of work you want, but if it is of this nature, and
you would like to consider it further, come up and
see me about it in my chambers. I shall be in at
tea-time, any afternoon this week. The best way
for you to get here is to come to the Temple Station.
Do not think any more about it, if you have already
heard of something else.</p>

<p class="left45">Yours sincerely,<br />

<span class="smcap i4">Paul Wilton</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>"Of course," said Katharine aloud, "I shall
go this very afternoon." Then she paused,
and looked smilingly into Phyllis Hyam's hot
face. "No; I mean to-morrow."</p>

<p>"What?" said Phyllis, looking perplexed.
"I thought you wanted it now, and I made
it on purpose."</p>

<p>"You dear thing! of course I want it now.
You are an angel of goodness, and I am a
cross old bear," exclaimed Katharine, with a
burst of unusual cordiality; and Phyllis was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
consumed with curiosity as to the writer of
that letter.</p>

<p>It was not difficult to find Paul Wilton's
chambers among the quaint old buildings of
Essex Court; and Katharine, as she toiled up
the massive oak staircase, stopping on every
landing to read the names over the doors,
felt that she had reached a delightful oasis of
learning in the middle of commercial London.</p>

<p>"How splendid to be a man, and to have
brains enough to live in a place like this,"
she thought enthusiastically; and then, with
the cynicism that always dogged the steps of
her enthusiasm, she added, "It probably only
wants money enough, though."</p>

<p>Paul Wilton opened his own door to her.
He looked really glad to see her, and Katharine
flushed with pleasure when he kept hold
of her hand and drew her into his room.</p>

<p>"This is most good of you," he said; and
on the impulse of the moment Katharine let
herself be surprised into an indiscretion.</p>

<p>"I was so glad to have your letter; I wanted
to see you again dreadfully," she said, without
reflection. She meant what she said, but she
saw from his manner that she ought not to
have said it. Any sentiment that was crudely
expressed was always distasteful to him; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
he at once dropped her hand, and pulled
forward an arm-chair with a great show of
courtesy.</p>

<p>"Is that comfortable, or do you prefer a
high one? I thought you might come, one
day; but I hardly expected you so soon. It
is rather wet, too, isn't it?"</p>

<p>Something impelled her to meet his irritating
self-assurance with ridicule.</p>

<p>"Very wet," she replied demurely. "In
fact, now I come to think of it, there are
a great many reasons why I should not have
come. But the one that brought me here, in
spite of them all, was a matter of business,
if you remember."</p>

<p>If he minded being laughed at, he certainly
did not show it, for his tone was much more
natural when he answered her.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, about the school! It is not far
from you,&mdash;near Paddington, in fact. It is
rather a swagger place, I believe; Mrs. Downing
is the widow of an old friend of mine,
who was killed out in Africa, and she started
this concern after his death. She knows
nothing about education, but a great deal about
etiquette, and as this is also the position of
the mothers of most of her pupils, she has
no difficulty in convincing them of her capabilities.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
She is quite flourishing now, I believe.
Can you teach arithmetic?"</p>

<p>They discussed the vacant appointment
solemnly, with the result that Katharine
agreed to accept it if Mrs. Downing approved
of her. The salary was not large, but she
had learnt by now not to be too particular,
and it offered her an opening, at all events.</p>

<p>"I am sure she will like you all right. I
told her about your people, and so on, and a
clergyman is always a guarantee in such cases.
And now for tea."</p>

<p>They talked about the historic associations
of the Temple while the housekeeper was
bringing in tea; and they talked very little
about anything after she had left. Paul was
in one of his unaccountable silent moods, and
they were never conducive to conversation.
He roused himself a little to show her some
of his treasures,&mdash;an old bit of tapestry, some
Japanese prints, a Bartolozzi; but the afternoon
was not a success, and his depression
soon communicated itself to Katharine.</p>

<p>"I must be going," she said at last, after
an awkward pause that he showed no signs
of breaking. They stood for a moment in
the middle of the room.</p>

<p>"It was good of you to come like this,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
he said, with the slightly worried look he
always wore in his morose moods. "I was
afraid, perhaps, that I ought not to have asked
you."</p>

<p>Her questioning look invited him to continue.</p>

<p>"Not being sure what day you would
come, I was unable to provide a chaperon,
don't you see? But, of course, if you don't
mind, that doesn't matter."</p>

<p>"Of course I don't mind," she said, with
a reassuring smile. "Why should I? I know
you so well, don't I?"</p>

<p>He continued his explanation, as though
he had decided to make it beforehand, and
did not mean to be deterred by her unwillingness
to hear it.</p>

<p>"Under the circumstances," he said gravely,
"you will see that it would be wiser for you
not to come here again."</p>

<p>Katharine did not see, and she showed it
in her face.</p>

<p>"If I were married," he continued, in a
lighter tone, "it would be different; but
there are many reasons which have made it
impossible for me to marry, and there are still
more now, which will prevent my ever doing
so. And since I am a bachelor, it is obviously
better for you to keep away."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span></p>

<p>In spite of his assumed carelessness, Katharine
felt instinctively that it was to hear this that
he had asked her to come and see him to-day.
And, like many another woman who has to
face as embarrassing a disclosure from a man,
her great desire at the moment was to conceal
that she had ever entertained the idea of his
marrying her at all.</p>

<p>"But does it matter, so long as I don't
mind?" she asked, pulling on her gloves for
the sake of the occupation. He bent down
to button them for her, and their eyes met.
"Let me come again," she said impulsively.
"You know I think propriety is all rubbish.
Besides, I want to come. We can go on
being friends, can't we? <i>I</i> don't care what
other people think!"</p>

<p>"I only care for your sake, not for my
own. No, child, it is safer not; you are not
the sort. Don't think any more about it. I
am old enough to be your father, and have
seen more of the world than you. I would
not allow you, if you did wish it."</p>

<p>"It is all rubbish," repeated Katharine.
"Why am I not the sort? I don't understand;
I am tired of being told that. If that
is all, I&mdash;I wish I were!"</p>

<p>Paul half wished it too, as she stood there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
in the firelight, with the glow all over her
face and hair; but he laughed away the
thought.</p>

<p>"You are an absurd child; you don't know
what you are saying. It is lucky there is no
one else to hear you. There, go away, and
make it up with young Morton! Oh, no,
I know nothing whatever about it, I swear I
don't; but he won't do you any harm, and
he isn't old, and worn out, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't, please don't!" said Katharine, imploringly.
"Ted is only like my brother;
I love him, but it is altogether different.
Mayn't I really see you any more?"</p>

<p>She was threatening to become unpleasantly
serious, and Paul switched on the electric light
and fetched his coat hastily.</p>

<p>"Why, surely, lots of times, I expect.
What a desperately solemn person you are!
I believe you work too hard, don't you?
Now, I am not going to let you walk to the
station alone, so come along."</p>

<p>And Katharine realised, with a hot blush,
that she had made a second blunder.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p>The lady principal of the school near Paddington
had too high an opinion of her distinguished
and influential friend, Mr. Wilton,
to refuse a teacher who was so warmly recommended
by him, more especially as her junior
mistress had left her most inconveniently in
the middle of term; so Katharine found herself
installed there, about three weeks before
the Easter holidays, with a class of thirty children
in her sole charge. The teaching was
only elementary, but there was plenty to be
done; and she soon found that, although she
was ostensibly only wanted in the mornings,
she had to spend most of her afternoons also
in correcting exercises. But the work interested
her, and she had no difficulty in
managing the children,&mdash;a fact which surprised
her as much as it did Mrs. Downing, who had
expected very little from her youthful looking
teacher, in spite of her recommendation
by Mr. Wilton. Mrs. Downing was a well-dressed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
little woman, with charming manners
and an unbounded belief in herself. By resolutely
playing on the weaknesses of others,
she concealed her own shallowness of mind;
and she made up for her lack of brains by
contriving to have clever people always about
her. She had chatted herself into a fashionable
and paying connection in that part of Bayswater
which calls itself Hyde Park; and if she
employed tact and dissimulation in order to
entrap the mothers of the neighbourhood, she
was, to do her justice, genuine in her love of
their children. Katharine would have found it
difficult to like such a woman, had not a two
months' sojourn with working gentlewomen
taught her to tolerate weaknesses which would
formerly have excited her contempt; and she
endured her smiles and her blandishments
with a stoicism that arose from a knowledge
of their harmlessness. But Mrs. Downing
remained in ignorance of the fact that her
youngest teacher, with the serious face and the
childish manner, was able to see right through
her; and the impenetrability which saved her
from feeling a snub, also spared her the knowledge
that Katharine was laughing at her.</p>

<p>One morning, about a week after she had
begun her work as junior teacher, Katharine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
was interrupted in the middle of her first lesson
by the precipitate entrance of the lady
principal.</p>

<p>"My dear Miss Austen," she began effusively,
and then paused suddenly; for there was
something about Katharine, in spite of her
youthful look, which warned intruders that she
was not to be interrupted so lightly as the other
teachers. On this occasion she finished explaining
to the children that saying Mary
Howard was "<i>in</i> the second piano" did not
accurately express the fact that Mary Howard
was practising in the second music-room; and
then turned to see who had come in.</p>

<p>"My dear Miss Austen," began Mrs.
Downing again, "so good of you to look after
their English; they are apt to be so careless! I
am always telling them of it myself, am I not,
dear children? Ah, Carry, what an exquisite
rose; such colouring; beautiful, beautiful! For
me? Thanks, my sweet child; that is so dear
of you! My dear Miss Austen, you are so
obliging always, and my literature lecturer has
suddenly disappointed me, and the first class
will have nothing to do in the next hour. So
tiresome of Mr. Fletcher! His wife is ill, and
he is such a good husband,&mdash;quite a model!
So I have set them an essay; I cannot <i>bear</i> to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
have the ordinary work interrupted; and
would you be so good as to leave the door
open between the two rooms, and give them a
little, just a little supervision? That is so
dear of you; it has taken a load off my mind.
Dear children, listen with all your might to
everything Miss Austen has to say, and you
will soon be so clever and so wise&mdash;I beg your
pardon, Miss Austen?"</p>

<p>"Isn't it rather a pity for them to miss their
lecture altogether?" said Katharine, in the first
breathing space. "I mean, I could give them
one if you liked, on something else. My class
is being drilled in the next hour, and I have
nothing particular to do."</p>

<p>"But I should be charmed, delighted;
nothing could be more opportune! My dear
Miss Austen, I have found a treasure in you.
Children, you must make the most of your
teacher while she is with you, for I shall have
to take her away from you, quite soon! Miss
Austen, I shall come and listen to your lecture
myself. I will go and prepare the girls&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I think, perhaps, something quite different
would be best," said Katharine, detaining her
with difficulty. "Would you like it to be on
Gothic architecture?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Downing did not know the difference
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
between a pinnacle and a buttress, but she hastened
to say she would like Gothic architecture
better than anything else in the world, and
had, in fact, been on the point of suggesting it
herself; after which, she went to interrupt
the first class also, and Katharine devoted her
energies to collecting the wandering attention
of her own pupils.</p>

<p>At the end of her lecture the lady principal
hastened up to her.</p>

<p>"How extremely interesting, to be sure!
I had no idea those vaults, and pillars, and
things, were so beautiful before. Where
did you find out all that? I should like to
learn it up myself in the holidays, and give
a course of lessons on it to the first class
next term."</p>

<p>Katharine tried not to smile.</p>

<p>"I have been learning it all my life, from
my father. I don't think I know any textbooks;
it would be difficult to read it up in a
hurry, I should think." But the lady principal
never allowed herself to be thwarted,
when she had a fresh idea. Besides, Gothic
architecture was quite new, and would be sure
to take in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>"Then you must give a course yourself to
the whole school, my dear Miss Austen," she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
exclaimed. "I insist upon it; and we will
begin the first Wednesday of next term."</p>

<p>Anything that promised an addition to her
salary was sure to be agreeable to Katharine,
and she was only too pleased to agree. But,
meanwhile, her finances were in a deplorable
condition. She found herself with nothing but
the change out of half a sovereign, about ten
days before the end of the term; and although
she could easily have asked Miss Jennings to
give her credit until she received her salary, she
had all a woman's hyper-sensitiveness of conscience,
and all her disregard of the importance
of food as well; and she resolutely set to work
to starve herself during those ten days. Fortunately,
she was constitutionally strong, and
she never reached the stage of privation when
food becomes distasteful; but there was little
consolation for her in the fact that she remained
healthily hungry all the time, and had to run
past the pastry-cooks' shops to escape their
seductive display. Long walks at supper time
did not compensate for a meal that was satisfying,
if it was not very tempting; and the irony
of it all was forced upon her with a somewhat
grim significance by something that occurred,
when she came up to bed one evening, tired
out and dispirited. She noticed that the girls
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
stopped talking directly she entered the room;
but this would not have aroused her suspicions,
if Phyllis Hyam had not made a point of conversing
vigorously with her through the curtains,
and being more brusque than usual when
the others tried to interrupt her.</p>

<p>"Good old Phyllis," reflected Katharine.
"They have evidently been abusing me. I
wonder what I have done!"</p>

<p>Phyllis enlightened her somewhat unwillingly,
the next morning, when the others had
gone down to breakfast.</p>

<p>"Don't bother about them; <i>I</i> wouldn't.
Mean cats! It's jealousy, of course. Fact is,
Polly saw you in a hansom with a man, some
time back; she came home full of it. Said you
were no better than the rest of us, after all. I
said you never pretended to be; it was our own
look out, if we chose to think so. Besides, it
was most likely your brother, I said. Polly
said it wasn't; you looked so happy, and he
was smiling at you."</p>

<p>"Conclusive evidence," murmured Katharine,
with her mouth full of hair-pins. "Did
she describe the gentleman in question? It
might be useful for future identification."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, she did! Said he was rather like
a corpse with a black beard; had a flavour of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
dead loves about him, I think she said; but I
don't quite know what she was driving at.
And I'm sure I don't care."</p>

<p>"I do. It is most entertaining. Was that
all they said?"</p>

<p>Phyllis hesitated, said she was not going to
tell any more, and finally told every detail.</p>

<p>"I said they were mean, despicable liars,
especially Polly, considering how much you
have done for her! And I said that if ever I
had the chance&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But what did <i>they</i> say?" interrupted
Katharine.</p>

<p>"Oh, bother! what does it matter? They
are a pack of mean sneaks. They said you
were never in to lunch now, or supper either;
and Polly was sure she had seen you walking
with some one, only yesterday evening, and
that you went into a restaurant with him; and
she declares you see him every day, and that
you are going all wrong. I said I should like
to kill her. And they all said you must have
gone wrong, because you are never in to supper
now. I said I should like to kill them
all for telling such a false lie, whether it was
true or not! It isn't their business whether
you choose to come in to supper or not, is it?
And then you came in, and&mdash;&nbsp;Why, whatever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
is the joke now? Mercy me; I thought you
would be furious!"</p>

<p>For, of course, it was not to be supposed
that she should know why Katharine was rolling
on her bed in a paroxysm of laughter.</p>

<p>But the holidays came at last, and she congratulated
herself proudly on not having given
in once. She left school on the last day of the
term with a light heart; everything had made
her laugh that morning, from the children's
jubilation at the coming holiday, to Mrs.
Downing's characteristic farewell. "Don't
overwork in the holidays, my dear Miss
Austen," she had said, shaking Katharine
warmly by both hands. "You look quite
worn out; I am afraid you take things a little
too seriously, do you not? When you have
had <i>my</i> experience in school work, you will
think nothing of a class like yours! Perhaps
you do not eat enough? Take my advice, and
try maltine; it is an excellent tonic for the
appetite!" And Katharine walked out into
the sunshine and the warm air, with a feeling
of joy at the thought of the cheque she was to
receive on the morrow. There was only one more
day of privation for her; and she called herself
greedy for thinking about it, and laughed at her
own greediness, all in the same breath. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
might easily have humbled her pride and gone
home to lunch like a rational being, now that
she saw her way to paying for it; but such a
weakness as that never entered her head for
a moment, and she walked gaily on instead,
weaving a rosy dream of the feast she would
have if her pocket were full of money. But
it was nearly empty, and she only found twopence
there when she put her hand in to feel;
and she jingled the coppers together, and
laughed again, and hurried on a little faster.
At Hyde Park Corner a beggar pursued her
with his studied tale of distress: he had no
home, he whined, and he had eaten nothing for
days. "Just my case," said Katharine cheerfully,
and a spirit of recklessness impelled her
to drop the two pennies into his grimy palm,
and then hasten on as before.</p>

<p>"Well met," said a voice behind her. "But
what a hurry you are in, to be sure! Where
are you off to, now?"</p>

<p>She looked round and saw Paul Wilton,
smiling unaffectedly at her in a way that
recalled the old days at Ivingdon. Perhaps,
the fine day had influenced him too; certainly,
he had not been starving for a fortnight, nor
would he have seen the humour of it, probably,
if he had. But these reflections did not occur
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
to Katharine; it was enough for her that he
looked more pleased than usual, and that his
manner had lost its constraint.</p>

<p>"I am not going anywhere. The spring
has got into my head, that's all; and I felt
obliged to walk. Besides, it is the first day
of my first holidays!" and she laughed out
joyously.</p>

<p>"Yes? You look very jolly over it, any
way. Have you lunched yet?"</p>

<p>"Yes,&mdash;I mean, no. I don't want any
lunch to-day," she said hastily. "Don't let us
talk about lunch; it spoils it so."</p>

<p>"But, my dear child, I really must talk
about it. I have had nothing to eat since supper
last night, and I am going to have some
lunch now. You've got to come along, too, so
don't make any more objections. I'm not a
healthy young woman like you, and I can't eat
my three courses at breakfast, and then fast
until it is time to spoil my digestion by afternoon
tea. Where shall we go? Suppose you
stop chuckling for a moment and make a
suggestion."</p>

<p>"But I don't know any places, and I don't
really want anything to eat," protested Katharine.
She would not have been so independent,
if she had been a little less hungry. "There's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
a confectioner's along here, that always looks
rather nice," she added, remembering one she
had often passed lately with a lingering look, at
its attractive contents.</p>

<p>"Nonsense! that's only a shop. Have you
ever been in here?"</p>

<p>Katharine confessed that she had never
lunched at a restaurant before; and the savoury
smell that greeted them as they entered reminded
her how very hungry she was, and
drove away her last impulse to object.</p>

<p>"Never? Why, what has Ted been up to?
Now, you have got to say what you like; this
is your merrymaking, you know, because it is
the first day of the holidays."</p>

<p>"Oh, but I can't; you must do all that,
<i>please</i>. You don't know how beautiful it is to
be taken care of again."</p>

<p>"Is it?" They smiled at each other across
the little table, and the old understanding
sprang up between them.</p>

<p>"You're looking very charming," he said,
when he had given the waiter his preliminary
instructions. "You may abuse the food at
your place as much as you like, but it certainly
seems to agree with you."</p>

<p>"I don't think," said Katharine carelessly,
"that it has anything to do with the food."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course not; my mistake. No doubt
it is natural charm triumphing over difficulties.
Try some of this, to begin with; bootlaces or
sardines?"</p>

<p>Katharine looked perplexed.</p>

<p>"What a delightful child you are," he
laughed. "It's to give you an appetite for
the rest. I advise the bootlaces. Nonsense!
you must do as you are told, for a change. I
am not one of your pupils. Besides, it is
the first day of the holidays."</p>

<p>And Katharine, who had no desire for a
larger appetite than she already possessed, ate
the <i>hors d'&oelig;uvre</i> with a relish, and longed for
more, and wondered if she should ever attain
to the extreme culture of her companion, who
was playing delicately with the sardine on his
plate.</p>

<p>"Don't you ever feel hungry?" she asked
him. "It seems to add to your isolation that
you have none of the ordinary frailties of the
flesh. I really believe it would quite destroy
my illusion of you, if I ever caught you enjoying
a penny bun!"</p>

<p>"You may preserve the illusion, if you like,
and remember that I am not a woman. It is
only women who&mdash;&nbsp;Well, what is it now,
child?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span></p>

<p>"Do explain this," she begged him, with a
comical expression of dismay. "Why is it
red?"</p>

<p>"I should say because, fundamentally, it is
red mullet. It would never occur to me to
inquire more deeply into it; but the rest
is probably accounted for by the carte, if you
understand French. Don't you think you had
better approach it, fasting and with faith?"</p>

<p>"Go on about your appetite, please; it is
so awfully entertaining," resumed Katharine.
"I believe, if you found yourself really hungry
one day, force of habit would still make you
eat your lunch as though you didn't want it a
bit. Now, wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>"My dear Miss Katharine, you have yet to
learn that hunger does not give you a desire
for more food, but merely imparts an element
of pleasure to it. Go on with your fish, or
else the entrée will catch you up."</p>

<p>"I am glad," said Katharine, in the interval
between the courses, "that I'm not a superior
person like you. It must be so lonely,
isn't it?"</p>

<p>"What wine will you drink? White or
red?" asked Paul severely.</p>

<p>"Living with you," continued Katharine,
leaning back and looking mischievously at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
what was visible of him over the wine list,
"must be exactly like living with Providence."</p>

<p>"Number five," said Paul to the waiter,
laying down the wine list. Then he looked at
her, and shook his head reprovingly.</p>

<p>"You see you don't live with me, do you?"
he said drily.</p>

<p>"No," retorted Katharine hastily. "I live
with sixty-three working gentlewomen, and
that is a very different matter."</p>

<p>"Very," he assented, looking so searchingly
at her that she found herself beginning to
blush. The arrival of the wine made a
diversion.</p>

<p>"Oh," said Katharine, "I am quite sure I
can't drink any champagne."</p>

<p>"If you had not been so occupied in firing
off epigrams, you might have had some choice
in the matter. As it is, you have got to do as
you are told."</p>

<p>He filled her glass, and she felt that it was
very pleasant to do as she was told by him;
and her eyes glistened as they met his over the
brimming glasses.</p>

<p>"I am so happy to-day," she felt obliged
to tell him.</p>

<p>"That's right. Because it is the first day
of the holidays?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span></p>

<p>"Because you are so nice to me, I think,"
she replied softly; and then was afraid lest
she had said too much. But he nodded, and
seemed to understand; and she dropped her
eyes suddenly and began crumbling her bread.</p>

<p>"What makes you so nice to me, I wonder,"
she continued in the same tone. This time he
became matter-of-fact.</p>

<p>"The natural order of the universe, I suppose.
Man was created to look after woman,
and woman to look after man; don't you
think so?"</p>

<p>She understood him well enough, by now,
to know when to take her tone from him.</p>

<p>"At all events, it saves Providence a lot of
trouble," she said; and they laughed together.</p>

<p>Their lunch was a success; and Paul smiled
at her woe-begone face when the black coffee
had been brought, and she was beginning
slowly to remember that there was still such a
place as number ten, Queen's Crescent, and
that it actually existed in the same metropolis
as the one that contained this superb
restaurant.</p>

<p>"It is nearly over, and it has been so beautiful,"
she sighed.</p>

<p>"Nonsense! it has only just begun. It isn't
time to be dull yet; I'll tell you when it is,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
said Paul briskly; and he called for a daily
paper.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" gasped Katharine,
opening her eyes wide in anticipation of new
joys to come.</p>

<p>"We're going to a matinee, of course.
Let's see,&mdash;have you any choice?"</p>

<p>"A theatre? Oh!" cried Katharine. Then
she reddened a little. "You won't laugh if I
tell you something?"</p>

<p>"Tell away, you most childish of children!"</p>

<p>"I've never been to a theatre before, either."</p>

<p>They looked at the paper together, and
laughed one another's suggestions to scorn, and
then found they had only just time to get to the
theatre before it began. And she sat through
the three acts with her hand lying in his; and
to her it was a perfect ending to the most perfect
day in her life. He took her home afterwards,
and left her at the corner of the street.</p>

<p>"I won't come to the door; better not,
perhaps," he said, and his words sent a sudden
feeling of chill through her. They seemed to
have fallen back into the conventional attitude
again, the most appropriate one, probably, for
Edgware Road, but none the less depressing
on that account.</p>

<p>"You are not going to be sad, now?" he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
added, half guessing her thoughts. She looked
up in his face and made an effort to be bright.</p>

<p>"It has been beautiful all the time," she
said. "I never knew anything could be so
beautiful before."</p>

<p>"Ah," he said, smiling back; "it is the first
day of your first holidays, you see. We will
do it again some day." But she knew as he
spoke that they never could do it again.</p>

<p>She saw him occasionally during the Easter
holidays. He sent for her once about a pupil
he had managed to procure her, and once
about some drawing-room lectures he tried to
arrange for her, and which fell through. But
on both these occasions he was in his silent
mood, and she came away infected by his dulness.
Then she met him one day in the neighbourhood
of Queen's Crescent, and they had
a few minutes conversation in the noise and
bustle of the street, that left her far happier
than she had been after a tête-à-tête in his
chambers.</p>

<p>She went home for a few days at the end of
her holidays, but her visit was not altogether
a success. It was a shock to her to find that
home was no longer the same now that she
had once left it; and she did not quite realise
that the change was in herself as much as in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
those she had left behind her. Her father had
grown accustomed to living without her, and
it hurt her pride to find that she was no longer
indispensable to him. Her old occupations
seemed gone, and there was no time to substitute
new ones; she told herself bitterly that
she had no place in her own home, and that
she had burnt her ships when she went out to
make herself a new place in the world. Ivingdon
seemed narrower in its sympathies and
duller than ever; she wondered how people
could go on living with so few ideas in their
minds, and so few topics of conversation; even
the Rector irritated her by his want of interest
in her experiences and by his utter absorption
in his own concerns. Miss Esther added to
her feeling of strangeness by treating her with
elaborate consideration; she would have given
anything to be scolded instead, for being profane,
or for lying on the hearthrug. But they
persisted in regarding her as a child no longer;
and she felt graver and more responsible at
home, than she had done all the time she was
working for her living in London.</p>

<p>On the whole, she was glad when school began
again; and she grew much happier when
she found herself once more engrossed in the
term's work, which had now increased very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
materially, owing to her own efforts as well as
to those of Paul. Of him, she only had occasional
glimpses during the next few weeks;
but they were enough to keep their friendship
warm, and she soon found herself scribbling
little notes to him, when she had anything to
tell,&mdash;generally about some small success of
hers which she felt obliged to confide to some
one, and liked best of all to confide to him.
Sometimes he did not answer them; and she
sighed, and took the hint to write no more
for a time. And sometimes he wrote back
one of his ceremonious replies, which she had
learnt to welcome as the most characteristic
thing he could have sent her; for, in his letters,
Paul never lost his formality. It was a
very satisfactory friendship on both sides, with
enough familiarity to give it warmth, and not
enough to make it disquieting. But it received
an unexpected check towards the middle of
June, through an incident that was slight
enough in itself, though sufficient to set both
of them thinking. And to stop and think in
the course of a friendship, especially when it is
between a man and a woman, is generally the
forerunner of a misunderstanding.</p>

<p>It was the first hot weather that year. May
had been disappointingly cold and wet, after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
the promise of the month before, but June
came in with a burst of sunshine that lasted
long enough to justify the papers in talking
about the drought. On one of the first fine
days, Paul was lazily smoking in his arm-chair
after a late breakfast, when a knock at his
outer door roused him unpleasantly from a
reverie that had threatened to become a nap;
and he rose slowly to his feet with something
like a muttered imprecation. Then he remembered
that he had left the door open for
the sake of the draught, and he shouted a
brief "Come in," and sank back again into
his chair. A light step crossed the threshold,
and paused close behind him.</p>

<p>"Who's there?" asked Paul, without moving.</p>

<p>"Well, you <i>are</i> cross. And on a morning
like this, too!"</p>

<p>Paul got up again, with rather more than
his usual show of energy, and turned and
stared at his visitor.</p>

<p>"Really, Katharine," he said, with a slowly
dawning smile of amusement.</p>

<p>"Oh, I know all that," exclaimed Katharine,
with an impatient gesture. "But the
sun was shining, and I had to come, and
you'll have to put up with it."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span></p>

<p>Paul looked as though he should have no
difficulty in putting up with it; and he went
outside, and sported his oak.</p>

<p>"Won't you sit down, and tell me why you
have come?" he suggested, when he came
back again. Katharine dropped into a chair,
and laughed.</p>

<p>"How can you ask? Why, it is my half-term
holiday; and the sun's shining. Look!"</p>

<p>"I believe it is, yes," he said, glancing
towards the gently flapping blind. "Has
that got anything to do with it?"</p>

<p>"Of course it has. I believe, I do believe
you never would have known it was a fine day
at all, if I had not come to see you!"</p>

<p>"I can hardly believe that you did come
to see me for the purpose of telling me it
was a fine day," said Paul.</p>

<p>Katharine leaned over the back of her chair,
and nodded at him.</p>

<p>"Guess why I did come," she said. He
shook his head lazily. She imparted the rest
of her news in little instalments, to give it
more emphasis. "It's my half-term holiday,"
she said again, and paused to watch the effect
of her words.</p>

<p>"I think I heard you say that before," he
observed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span></p>

<p>"And I'm going into the country for the
whole day."</p>

<p>"Yes?" said Paul, who did not seem
impressed.</p>

<p>"And I want you to come too. There!
don't you think it was worth a visit?" Her
laugh rang out, and filled the little room.
Paul was stroking his beard reflectively, but
he did not seem vexed.</p>

<p>"Really, Katharine," he said once more.</p>

<p>"Oh, now, don't be musty," she pleaded,
resting her chin on her hands. "I just
want to do something jolly to-day; and I've
never asked you anything before, have I?
Do, <i>please</i>, Mr. Wilton. I won't bother you
again for ever so long; I promise you I
won't."</p>

<p>"Are you aware," said Paul, frowning,
"that it is not customary to come and visit
a man in his chambers in this uninvited
manner?"</p>

<p>"You know quite well," retorted Katharine,
"that nothing ever matters, if I do it."</p>

<p>"Of course I know that you are beyond
the taint of scandal, or the&mdash;"</p>

<p>She started up impatiently, and came over
to the side of his arm-chair.</p>

<p>"Don't begin to be sarcastic. I never can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
think of the word I want, when you get sarcastic.
I am not beyond anything, and I am
certainly not above asking you a favour.
Now, if you were to stop being superior for
a few minutes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And if you were to stop standing on one
leg, and swinging the other about in that juvenile
manner, a catastrophe might be&mdash;"</p>

<p>She seized a cushion and tried to smother
him with it; but he was too quick for her,
and the cushion went spinning to the other
end of the room, and she found herself pulled
on to his knee.</p>

<p>"You dreadful child! It is too hot, and
I am too old for romping in this fashion," he
observed lazily.</p>

<p>"Are you coming?" she asked abruptly.
She was playing with his watch chain, and
he did not quite know what to make of her
face.</p>

<p>"Do you want me to?" he asked gently.</p>

<p>"Of course I do," she said, in a swift little
whisper; and her fingers strayed up to his
scarf pin, and touched his beard.</p>

<p>"I am being dreadfully improper," she said.</p>

<p>"You are being very nice," he replied, and
weakly kissed her fingers. She did not move,
and he gave her a little shake.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span></p>

<p>"What a solemn child you are," he complained.
"It is impossible to play with you,
because you always take one so seriously."</p>

<p>"I know," said Katharine, rousing herself
and looking penitent. "I am so sorry! I am
made that way, I think. It used to annoy
Ted. I think it is because I never had any
fun at home, or any one to play with, except
Ted. And then I began to earn my living,
and so I never had time to be frivolous at
all. I suppose I am too old to begin, now."</p>

<p>"Much too old," smiled Paul.</p>

<p>A knock came at the outer door. Paul put
her away from him almost roughly, and glanced
with a disturbed look round the room.</p>

<p>"You had better stay here," he said shortly,
"and keep quiet till I come back."</p>

<p>"Who is it?" asked Katharine, in some
bewilderment.</p>

<p>"I don't know. You don't understand,"
was all he said; and he went out and spoke
for a few minutes to a man on the landing.</p>

<p>"It was about a brief," he said on his return.
He still frowned a little, and she felt,
regretfully, that his genial mood had fled.</p>

<p>"Was that all? Wouldn't he come in?"
she asked.</p>

<p>Paul looked at her incredulously.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span></p>

<p>"It wasn't likely that I should ask him,"
he said, turning his back to her, and rummaging
among the papers on his desk. The colour
came into her face, and she was conscious of
having said something tactless, without exactly
knowing what.</p>

<p>"Shall I go away again?" she asked slowly.
The joy seemed suddenly to have been taken
out of her half-term holiday.</p>

<p>"You see, it is not for myself that I mind,"
he tried to explain quietly; "but if you were
to be seen in here alone, it would do for your
reputation at once, don't you see?"</p>

<p>Katharine looked as though she did not
see.</p>

<p>"But, surely, there is no harm in my coming
here?" she protested.</p>

<p>"Of course not; no harm at all. It isn't
that," said Paul hastily.</p>

<p>"Then," said Katharine, "if there is no
harm in it, why should I not come? It is
all rubbish, isn't it? I won't come any more
if it bothers you; but that is another matter."</p>

<p>"My dear child, do be reasonable! It is
not a question of my feelings at all. I like
you to come, but I don't want other people
to know that you do, because of what they
might say. It is for your sake entirely that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
I wish you to be careful. That is why I
don't come to see you at your place. Do
you see now?"</p>

<p>Katharine shook her head.</p>

<p>"It is either wrong, or it isn't wrong,"
she said obstinately. "I never dreamed that
there could be any harm in my coming to see
you, or I should not have come. And it was
so pleasant, and you have always been so nice
to me. Why did you not tell me before? I
don't see how it can be wrong, and yet it
can't be right, if I have got to pretend to
other people that I don't come. I hate hiding
things; I don't like the feel of it. I
wish I could understand what you mean."</p>

<p>"It is quite easy to understand," said Paul,
beginning to realise that his case, as stated baldly
by Katharine, was a very lame one. "It is not
wrong, as far as you and I are concerned; but
it is a hell of a world, and people will talk."</p>

<p>It was strong language for him to use; and
she felt again that it was her stupidity that
was annoying him. She sighed, and her voice
trembled a little.</p>

<p>"I don't see what it has to do with other
people at all. It is quite enough for me, if
you like me to come; and as for my reputation,
it seems to exist solely for the sake of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
the other people, so they may as well say
what they like about it. <i>I</i> don't care. It is
horrible of you to suggest such a lot of horrible
ideas. According to you, I ought to be
feeling ashamed of myself; but&mdash;&nbsp;I don't."</p>

<p>"Of course you don't," said Paul, smiling
in spite of himself; and he put his hand out
and drew her towards him. She was only
a child, he told himself, and he was old enough
to be her father.</p>

<p>"My dear little puritan," he added softly,
"you were never made to live in the world as
it is. If all women were like you, good
heavens! there wouldn't be any sin left."</p>

<p>"And I believe you would be sorry for
it, wouldn't you?" said Katharine suddenly.
But when, instead of contradicting her, he
tried to make her explain her meaning, she
only shook her head resolutely.</p>

<p>"I don't think I could; I hardly know
myself. It was only something that came
into my head at the moment. It was something
horrid; don't let us talk about it any
more. Are you coming out with me, or not?
Ah, I know you are not coming, now!"</p>

<p>She was swift to notice the least change in
his expression, and it had grown very dark in
the last ten minutes. He held her out at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
arms' length, by her two elbows, and smiled
rather uncomfortably.</p>

<p>"I think I won't to-day, dear. Another
time, eh? This brief must be looked to at
once; and I have some other work, too. Go
and enjoy your holiday, without me for a
discordant element."</p>

<p>Katharine flushed up hotly, and loosed herself
from his grasp. "I don't mind your not
coming," she said, looking steadily on the
ground, "but I don't think you need bother
to invent excuses for <i>me</i>."</p>

<p>Paul shrugged his shoulders with an indifference
that maddened her. "All right; I
won't, then. Go and find some one else for
a companion, and don't be a young silly.
Can't Ted get off for to-day?"</p>

<p>"You have never said so many horrid
things to me before," cried Katharine passionately.</p>

<p>"You have never been so difficult to please
before," observed Paul coolly. "Besides, I
was under the impression that I was making
rather a good suggestion."</p>

<p>"You always drag up Ted when you are
being particularly unkind! If I had wanted
to go out with Ted, I shouldn't have come to
you first."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span></p>

<p>Paul began to fear a scene; and he had
more than a man's horror of scenes. But he
could not help seeing the tears in her eyes
as she walked away to the door, and he caught
her up just as she was opening it.</p>

<p>"Aren't you going to say good-bye? It
may be some time before I see you again."
He determined, as he spoke, that it should
certainly be a very long time before he saw
her again. But she disarmed him by turning
round swiftly without a trace of her anger
left.</p>

<p>"Oh, why must it be some time? You
don't mean it, do you? Say you don't mean
it, Mr. Wilton," she implored.</p>

<p>"No, no; I was only joking," he said reassuringly.
"Quite soon, of course." And he
dropped a kiss on the little pink ear that was
nearest to him. But when he saw the look
on her face, and the quick way in which her
breath was coming and going, he blamed himself
for his indiscretion, and pushed her playfully
outside the door.</p>

<p>When Phyllis Hyam came home from the
office, that evening, she found Katharine on
the floor of her cubicle, mending stockings;
while the rest of her wardrobe occupied all
the available space to be seen. Katharine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
never did things by halves, and she very
rarely had the impulse to mend her clothes.</p>

<p>"Hullo! do you mean to say you are back
already?" cried Phyllis, tripping clumsily over
the dresses on the floor.</p>

<p>"That hardly demands an answer, does it?"
said Katharine, without looking up. She
threaded her needle, and added more graciously,
"I didn't go, after all."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Phyllis wonderingly. "I'm
sorry."</p>

<p>"You needn't bother, thanks. I didn't
want to go. I stayed at home instead, and
mended my clothes; they seemed to want it,
rather. I shall be quite respectable, now."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Phyllis again. "I should have
left it for a wet day, I think."</p>

<p>"Perhaps your work allows you to select
your holidays according to the weather. Mine
doesn't," said Katharine sarcastically.</p>

<p>Phyllis cleared the chair, and sat down
upon it.</p>

<p>"You've been crying," she said, with the
bluntness that estranged all her friends in time.
Katharine never minded it; it rather appealed
to her love of truth than otherwise.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! I was disappointed, that's all.
There was nothing really to cry about. I don't
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
know why I did. Don't sit there and stare,
Phyllis; I know I have made a sight of
myself."</p>

<p>"No, you haven't. Poor old dear!" said
Phyllis, with ill-timed affection. "I should
like to tell him what I think of him, I know!"
she added emphatically.</p>

<p>"What are you muttering about?" asked
Katharine.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing," said Phyllis. "Have you
had any tea?"</p>

<p>"I don't want any tea, thank you. I wish
you wouldn't bother. Go down and have
your own."</p>

<p>"Guess I shall bring it up here instead,
and then we can talk," said Phyllis. In about
ten minutes she returned, very much out of
breath, with a large tray.</p>

<p>Katharine looked up and frowned. "I said
I didn't want any," she said crossly. However,
she added that she believed there was
some shortbread on the book-case, which
Phyllis at once annexed; and her temper began
slowly to improve.</p>

<p>"Phyllis," she asked abruptly, after a long
pause, "what do you think of men?"</p>

<p>"That they are luxuries," returned Phyllis,
without hesitation. "If you've nothing to do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
all day but to play about, you can afford to
have a man or two around you; but if you're
busy, you can't do with them, anyhow."</p>

<p>"Why not?" demanded Katharine. "Don't
you think they help one along, rather?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it! First, they draw you on,
because you seem to hold off; and then, when
you begin to warm up, they come down with a
quencher, and you feel you've been a sight too
bold. And all that kind of thing is distracting;
and it affects your work after a time."</p>

<p>"But surely," said Katharine, "a girl can
have a man for a friend without going through
all that!"</p>

<p>"Don't believe in it; never did; it doesn't
work."</p>

<p>"I think it does, sometimes," observed
Katharine. "Of course it depends on the
girl."</p>

<p>"Entirely," said Phyllis cheerfully. "The
man would always spoil it, if he could&mdash;without
being found out."</p>

<p>Katharine leaned back on the pillow, with
her arms behind her head, and her eyes fixed
on the ceiling.</p>

<p>"That's just it," she said thoughtfully;
"men are so much more conventional than
women. I am glad I am not a man, after all.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
There is no need for a woman to be conventional,
is there? She isn't afraid of being
suspected, all the time. I'm certain conventionality
was made for man, and not man for
conventionality, and that woman never had a
hand in it at all."</p>

<p>"I don't know about that, though it sounds
very fine," said Phyllis. "But of course men
have to be more conventional than we are. It
helps them to make some show of respectability,
I guess."</p>

<p>"It is very horrible, if one analyses it," murmured
Katharine. "According to that, the
man who is openly bad is preferable to the man
who is conventionally good. Of course Paul
is not bad at all; but, oh! I do wish I didn't
see through people, when they try to pretend
things,&mdash;it always annoys them."</p>

<p>"Eh?" said Phyllis, looking up. "Your
tea is getting cold."</p>

<p>"Never mind about the tea! Tell me,
Phyllis, do you think any woman can attract
any man, if she likes?"</p>

<p>"Of course she can, if she is not in love
with him."</p>

<p>Katharine winced, and brought her eyes
down to look at her unconscious friend,
who was still munching shortbread with an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
expression of complete contentment on her
face.</p>

<p>"I mean if she <i>is</i> in love with him, very
much in love with him."</p>

<p>"Can't say; never was, myself. But I don't
believe you can do anything, if you've got it
badly; you have to let yourself go, and hope
for the best."</p>

<p>"I don't believe you know any more about
it than I do, Phyllis. I'll tell you what it is
that is attractive to a man in a woman: it is her
imperfections. He likes her to be jealous, and
vain, and full of small deceptions. He hates
her to be tolerant, and large-minded, and truthful;
above all, he hates her to be truthful. I
don't know why it is so, but it is."</p>

<p>"It is because she isn't too mighty big to
worship him, then; nor cute enough to see
through him," said Phyllis.</p>

<p>"If you can see through a man, you should
never fall in love with him," added Katharine.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know!" said Phyllis. "You
can always pretend not to see; they never
know."</p>

<p>"A nice man does," said Katharine, smiling
for the first time. The tea had made her feel
more charitable; and she took up her pen, and
wrote to her mother's connections, the Keeleys,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
who did not know she was in town, to ask
them when she could call and see them.</p>

<p>She felt the need of knowing some one, now
that she had made up her mind not to know
Paul any more. For he had taught her the
desire for companionship, and she shrank from
being left entirely friendless.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p>At first she was surprised to find that it was
so easy to get on without him. She persuaded
herself that her indifference arose from her annoyance
at his having imposed the conventional
view of things upon her; but, in reality,
it was due to her conviction that he would be
the first to give in, and would soon write and
ask her to go and see him. And she longed
for an opportunity to write and refuse him.
But when a fortnight passed by and no letter
came from him, her righteous scorn deserted
her and she became merely angry. The flatness
of being completely ignored was unendurable;
and she longed more than ever for a
chance of showing him that her dignity was
equal to his, although she was beginning to
fear that he was not going to give her the
necessary occasion. Then came days when she
felt reckless, and determined to cease thinking
about him at any cost; and she threw herself
into any distraction that offered itself, and tried
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
to think that she was quite getting over her
desire to see him. It was in one of these
moods that she went to call on the Keeleys,
who had written to tell her that they were
always at home on Thursdays. The fact of
putting on her best clothes was in itself some
satisfaction; it was a step towards restoring
her self-respect, at all events, and she felt happier
than she had been for some time past
as she walked down Park Lane and found her
way to their house in Curzon Street.</p>

<p>The Honourable Mrs. Keeley was the widow
of a peer's son who had been a cabinet minister
and had signalised his political career by supporting
every bill for the emancipation of women,
and his domestic one by impressing upon his
wife that her true sphere was the home. The
natural reaction followed after his death, when
Mrs. Keeley broke loose from the restraint
his presence had put upon her, and practised
the precepts he had loved to expound in public.
She became the most active of political women;
she spoke upon platforms; she harried the rate-payers
until they elected her favourite county
councillor; she canvassed in the slums for
the candidate who would vote for woman's
suffrage. She had a passion for everything
that was modern, irrespective of its value;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
and she spent the time that was not occupied
by her public duties in trying to force her
principles upon her only daughter. But Marion
Keeley refused to be modern, except in her
amusements; she accepted the bicycle and the
cigarette with equanimity, but she had no
desires to reform anything or anybody; she
merely wanted to enjoy herself as much as
possible, and she looked forward to making a
wealthy marriage in the future. Her greatest
ambition was to avoid being bored, and her
greatest trial was the energy of her mother.
She never pretended to be advanced; and she
felt that she had been wasted on the wrong
mother when she saw most of the girls of her
acquaintance burning to do things in defiance of
their old-fashioned parents. She chose her own
friends from the idle world of Mayfair; and so
it was that two distinct sets of people met in
the Keeleys' drawing-room on Thursday afternoons
and disapproved of each other.</p>

<p>Katharine received a warm reception from
her hostess. The fact that she belonged to
the class of working gentlewomen, about whom
Mrs. Keeley had many theories but little
knowledge, was a sufficient evidence of her
right to be encouraged; and she found herself
seated on an uncomfortable stool, and introduced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
to an East-end clergyman and a lady
inspector of factories within five minutes of
her entry into the room. She glanced rather
longingly towards the back drawing-room,
where her cousin Marion was looking very
pretty and was flirting very charmingly with
three smart-looking boys; but it was evident
that her aunt had labelled her as one of her
own set, and she resigned herself to her fate,
and agreed with the East-end clergyman that
the want of rain was becoming serious.</p>

<p>"My niece lectures, you know; strikingly
clever, and <i>so</i> young," said Mrs. Keeley in a
breathless aside to the lady inspector, as she
came back from the opposite side of the room,
where she had just coupled a socialist and a
guardian of the poor.</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said the lady inspector; and
Katharine began to lose her diffidence when
she found that she smiled quite like an ordinary
person. "Do you lecture on hygiene?
Because Mr. Hodgson-Pemberton is getting up
some popular lectures in his parish, and we
are trying to find a lecturer for hygiene?"</p>

<p>Mr. Hodgson-Pemberton became animated
for a moment; but when Katharine said,
apologetically, that her subjects were merely
literary, he took no further interest in her and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
resumed his conversation with the lady inspector
of factories. Katharine was left alone
again, and relapsed into one of her dreams,
until Marion recognised her and came and
fetched her into the back drawing-room.</p>

<p>"Isn't it refreshing?" she said to the boys,
who had now increased in number: "Kitty
doesn't know anything about politics, and she
doesn't want to be with the fogies at all, do
you, Kitty? And, for all that, she is dreadfully
clever, and gives lectures on all sorts of
things to all sorts of people. Oh, dear, I do
wish I were clever!"</p>

<p>"Oh, please don't be clever, Miss Keeley!
you won't know me any longer if you are,"
said her favourite boy, imploringly.</p>

<p>"You are far too charming to be clever,"
added another boy, who had been her favourite
last week, and was trying to regain his position
by elaborate compliments.</p>

<p>"That's rubbish," said Marion crushingly;
"and not very polite to my cousin, either."</p>

<p>The dethroned favourite did his best to repair
his blunder by assuring Katharine that he
would never have supposed her to be clever,
if he had not been told so. And when she
laughed uncontrollably at his remark, he chose
to be offended, and withdrew altogether.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span></p>

<p>"You shouldn't laugh at him. He can't
help it," said Marion, and she introduced a
third admirer to Katharine to get rid of him.
He had very little to say, and when she had
confessed that she did not bicycle, and never
went in the park because she was too busy,
he stared a little without speaking at all, and
then contrived to join again in the conversation
that was buzzing around Marion. Most
of the other people had left now, and Katharine
was trying to summon up courage to do
the same, when her aunt came up to her again,
and presented her to a weary-looking girl in
a big hat.</p>

<p>"You ought to know each other," she
said, effusively, "because you are both workers.
Miss Martin does gesso work, and has
a studio of her own; and my niece gives
lectures, you know."</p>

<p>They looked at one another rather hopelessly,
and Katharine resisted another impulse
to laugh.</p>

<p>"The knowledge of our mutual occupations
doesn't seem to help the conversation much,
does it?" she said; and the weary-looking
girl tried to smile.</p>

<p>"That's right," said Mrs. Keeley, resting
for a moment in a chair near them. "I knew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
you two would have plenty to say to each
other. That's the best of you working-women;
there is such a bond of sympathy
between you."</p>

<p>"Is there?" said Katharine, remembering
the sixty-three working-women at Queen's
Crescent, and her feelings towards them. But
Mrs. Keeley had ideas about women who
worked, and meant to air them.</p>

<p>"It is so splendid to think that women
can really do men's work, in spite of everything
that is said to the contrary," she
continued.</p>

<p>The weary-looking girl made no attempt to
contradict her, but Katharine was less docile.</p>

<p>"I don't think they can," she objected.
"They might, perhaps, if they had a fair
chance; but they haven't."</p>

<p>"But they are getting it every day," cried
Mrs. Keeley, waxing enthusiastic. "Think of
the progress that has been made, even in my
time; and in another ten years there will be
nothing that women will not be able to do
in common with men! Isn't it a glorious
reflection?"</p>

<p>"I don't think it will be so," persisted
Katharine. "It has nothing to do with education,
or any of those things. A woman is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
handicapped, just because she is a woman, and
has to go on living like a woman. There is
always home work to be done, or some one
to be nursed, or clothes to be mended. A
man has nothing to do but his work; but a
woman is expected to do a woman's work as
well as a man's. It is too much for any one
to do well. I am a working-woman myself,
and I don't find it so pleasant as it is painted."</p>

<p>"I'm <i>so</i> glad you think so," murmured
Marion, who had come up unobserved, with
her favourite in close attendance. "I was
afraid you would be on mamma's side, and
I believe you are on mine, after all."</p>

<p>At this point the weary-looking girl got
up to leave, as though she could not bear it
another minute, and Katharine tried to do
the same; but she was not to be let off so
easily.</p>

<p>"Tell me," said her aunt earnestly, "do
you not think that women are happier if they
have work to do for their living?"</p>

<p>"I suppose it is possible, but I haven't
met any who are," answered Katharine. "I
think it is because they feel they have sacrificed
all the pleasures of life. Men don't
like women who work, do they?"</p>

<p>The eyes of Marion met those of her favourite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
admirer; and Marion blushed. But
Mrs. Keeley returned to the charge.</p>

<p>"Indeed, there are many in my own acquaintance
who have the greatest admiration
for working-women."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," laughed Katharine, "they have
lots of admiration for us; but they don't
fall in love with us, that's all. I think it is
because it is the elusive quality in woman that
fascinates men; and directly they begin to
understand her, they cease to be fascinated by
her. And woman is growing less mysterious
every day, now; she is chiefly occupied in
explaining herself, and that is why men don't
find her such good fun. At least, I think so."</p>

<p>"You know us remarkably well, Miss Austen,
you do, really," drawled the favourite boy.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said Katharine, really getting
up this time, "I don't pretend to. But I do
know the working gentlewoman very well
indeed, and I don't think she is a bit like
the popular idea of her."</p>

<p>She was much pleased with herself as she
walked home; and even the bustle of Edgware
Road and the squalor of Queen's Crescent
failed to remove the pleasant impression
that her excursion into the fashionable world
had left with her. It comforted her wounded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
feelings to discover that she could hold her
own in a room full of people, although the
only man whose opinion she valued held her
of no more account than a child.</p>

<p>"Hullo! you seem pleased with yourself,"
said Polly Newland, as she entered the house.
The cockney twang of her voice struck un-musically
on Katharine's ear, and she murmured
some sort of ungracious reply and
turned to rummage in the box for letters.
There was one for her, and the sight of the
precise, upright handwriting drove every
thought of Polly, and the Keeleys, and her
pleasant afternoon out of her head. Even
then something kept her from reading it at
once, and she took it upstairs into her cubicle,
and laid it on the table while she changed
her clothes and elaborately folded up her best
ones and put them away. Then she sat down
on the bed and tore it open with trembling fingers,
and tried to cheat herself into the belief that
she was perfectly indifferent as to its contents.</p>

<p>"Dear child," it ran:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>What has become of you? Come round and have
tea with me to-morrow afternoon. I have some new
books to show you.</p>

<p class="left45">
Yours ever,<br />
<span class="smcap i4">Paul Wilton</span>.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span></p>

<p>Here at last was the opportunity she had
wanted. He should know now that she was
not a child, to be laughed at because she
was cross, to be ignored when she was hurt,
and to be coaxed back into good humour again
by a bribe. She would be able to show him
now that she was not the sort of woman he
seemed to consider her, and she told herself
several times that she was overjoyed at being
given the chance of telling him so. But when
it came to the point, she found that the cold,
dignified letter she had been composing for
weeks was not so easy to write; and she spent
the rest of the evening in thinking of new ones.
First of all, it was to be very short, and very
stiff; but that was not obvious enough to
gratify her injured feelings, and she set to
work on another one that was mainly sarcastic.
But sarcasm seemed a sorry weapon to use
when she had reached such a crisis in her life
as this; and she thought of another one in bed,
after the light was out, in which she determined
that he should know she was unhappy as well.
And this one was so pathetic that it even
roused her own pity, and she felt that it would
be positively inhuman to send such a letter
as that to any one, however badly he had
behaved.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span></p>

<p>In the end, she did not write to him at all.
It was more effective, she thought, to remain
silent. So she went to school the next morning
as usual, and gave her lessons as usual;
though she looked in the glass at intervals to
see if she were pale and had a sad expression,
which certainly ought to have been the case.
But even her head did not ache, which it did
sometimes; and Nature obstinately refused to
come to her assistance. She reached home
again about four o'clock, and the aspect of
the doorsteps and the area completed her discomfiture.
If they had only been a little less
squalid, a little more free from the domination
of cats, she might have retained her dignified
attitude to the end. But there was something
about them to-day that recalled the cosy little
room in the Temple by vivid contrast; and
she flung her pile of exercise books recklessly
upon the hall table, and hastened out of the
house again, without allowing herself time to
think.</p>

<p>"I was afraid you were not coming," he said,
and he greeted her with both hands. She
never remembered seeing him so unreserved
in his welcome before; and she marvelled at
herself for having attempted to keep away from
him any longer.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span></p>

<p>"It was because of the cats," she said, laughing
to hide her emotion. But she could not
hide anything from him; he knew something
of what she was thinking, and he bent down
and deliberately kissed her.</p>

<p>"Why did you do that?" she asked, trying
to free her hands to cover her burning face.</p>

<p>"Because you didn't stop me, I suppose,"
he replied, lightly.</p>

<p>"But I didn't know you were going to."</p>

<p>"Because I knew you wouldn't mind,
then."</p>

<p>She did not speak, and her eyes were
lowered.</p>

<p>"Did you mind, Katharine?"</p>

<p>"No," she whispered.</p>

<p>"Now, tell me why I am indebted to the
cats," he said, as he rang the bell for tea; and
for the rest of the afternoon they talked, as
Katharine laughingly said, "without any conversation."</p>

<p>There was no explanation on either side, no
attempt at facing the situation; and she felt
when she left him that she had thrown away
her last chance of controlling their friendship.
There had been a tacit struggle between their
two wills, and his had triumphed. She could
never put him out of her life now, unless he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
broke with her of his own accord; and she
realised bitterly, even while she was glad, that
he did not care enough for her to do that.</p>

<p>She saw him constantly all through the hot
months of July and August. She gave up her
original intention of going home for the summer
holidays, on the pretext of reading for her
next term's lectures at the British Museum;
but she did very little work in reality, and she
spent whole days in the reading-room, regardless
of the people around her, sometimes even
of the book before her, and dreamed long
hours away, making visions in which only
two people played any prominent part,&mdash;and
those two people were Paul and herself. Her
whole life seemed to be a kind of dream just
then, with a vivid incident here and there when
she met him or went to see him, and the rest a
vague nebula, in which something outside herself
made her do what was expected of her.
Sometimes she felt impelled to work furiously
hard for a day or two, or to take long walks by
herself, as though nothing else would tire her
restless energy; and then she would relapse
into her lethargic mood again, and do nothing
but watch vigilantly for the post, or haunt the
streets where she had sometimes met him.
And all the while she thought she was happy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
with a kind of weird, passionate happiness she
had never known before; and it seemed to
compensate for the hours of suspense and anxiety
she went through when he took no notice
of her. For his conduct was as inexplicable as
ever; and for one day that he was demonstrative
and even affectionate, she had to endure
many of indifference that almost amounted to
cruelty.</p>

<p>"We are horribly alike; it hurts me sometimes
when I suddenly find myself in you,"
she said to him one day, when he was in an
expansive mood.</p>

<p>"I am much honoured by the discovery,
but I fail to see where the likeness lies," was
his reply.</p>

<p>"It is not very definite," she said, thoughtfully.
"I think it must be because I feel
your changes of mood so quickly. We laugh
together at something, and everything seems
so fearfully nice; and then, suddenly, I feel
that something has sprung up between us, and
I look up and I see that you feel it too, and
all at once there is nothing to talk about.
Haven't you ever noticed it?"</p>

<p>"I think you are an absurdly sensitive little
girl," he said, smiling.</p>

<p>"Of course," she continued, without heeding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
his remark, "on the surface, no two people
could be more unlike than we are. You are so
awfully afraid of showing what you feel, for
instance; but I always tell you everything,
don't I?"</p>

<p>"My dear child, what nonsense! I am of
the most artless and confiding nature; while
you, on the contrary, never give yourself away
at all. Why, you never tell me anything I
really want to know! Whatever put such an
idea into that curious head of yours?"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't!" she cried. "You make me feel
quite hysterical! You have no right to upset
all my views on my own character, as well as
on yours. I <i>know</i> I am stupidly demonstrative.
I have often blushed all over because I
have told you things I never meant to tell any
one. How can you say I am reserved? I
only wish I were!"</p>

<p>"The few confidences of a reserved person
are always rash ones," observed Paul. "The
same might be said of the reflections of an
impulsive person, or the impulses of a reflective
one. It all comes from want of habit.
You can't alter your temperament, that's all."</p>

<p>"But I can't believe that I am reserved," she
persisted; "it seems incredible. And it makes
us more alike than ever."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span></p>

<p>"Really, Katharine, I beg you to rid your
mind of that exceedingly fallacious notion,"
said Paul, laughing. "I assure you I am to
be read like a book."</p>

<p>"A book in a strange language, then. I
don't think I shall ever be able to read it," said
Katharine, shaking her head. And she drew
down a rebuke upon herself for being solemn.</p>

<p>They had a tacit unwillingness to become
serious, about this time; their conversation
was made up of trivialities, and he never kissed
her except on the tips of her fingers. They
avoided any demonstration of feeling that
might have revealed to them the anomaly of
their position, and they mutually shrank from
defining their relations towards one another.</p>

<p>They were standing together at the window,
one day, looking down into Fountain Court,
which was as hot and as dusty as ever in spite
of the water that was playing into the basin in
the middle.</p>

<p>"What are you thinking about?" he asked
her, so suddenly that she was surprised into an
answer.</p>

<p>"I was thinking how queer it is that you
and I should be friends like this," she replied,
truthfully.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with our friendship,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
then?" he asked, in the prosaic manner he
always assumed when she showed any sentiment.
She laughed.</p>

<p>"There's nothing the matter with it, of
course. You are the most unromantic person
I ever knew. You seem to delight in divesting
every little trivial incident of its sentiment.
What makes you such a Vandal?"</p>

<p>"But, surely, you are not supposing that
there <i>is</i> any romance in our knowing each
other, are you?"</p>

<p>"I never dreamed of such a thing," retorted
Katharine. "I think there is more romance
in your cigarette holder than in the whole of
you!"</p>

<p>Sometimes she wondered if he were capable
of deep feeling at all, or if his indifference
were really assumed.</p>

<p>"I envy you your utter disregard of circumstance,"
she once exclaimed to him. "How
did you learn it? Do you really never feel
things, or is it only an easy way of getting
through life?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I don't see what you are driving
at. I dare say you are being very brilliant, but
I fail to discern what I am expected to say."</p>

<p>"You are not expected to say anything," she
said, playfully. "That is the best of being a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
gigantic fraud like yourself; nobody ever does
expect you to fulfil the ordinary requirements
of every-day life. You might be a heathen god,
who grins heartlessly while people try to propitiate
him with the best they have to offer, and
who eats up their gifts greedily when they are
not looking."</p>

<p>"Has all this any reference to me, might I
ask?"</p>

<p>"I don't believe you've got any ordinary
human feeling," pursued Katharine. "I don't
believe you care for anybody or anything, so
long as you are left alone. Why don't you say
something, instead of staring at me as though I
were a curiosity?"</p>

<p>"If you reflect, you will see that there has
not been a single pause since you began to
speak. Besides, why shouldn't you be catechised
as well as myself? Where do you keep
all your deep feeling, please? I haven't seen
much of it, but perhaps I have no right to
expect such a thing. No doubt you keep it
all for some luckier person than myself."</p>

<p>His tone was one of raillery, as hers had
been when she began to talk. But she startled
him, as she did sometimes, by a sudden change
of mood; and she flashed round upon him
indignantly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span></p>

<p>"It is horrible of you to laugh at me. You
know you don't mean what you say; you know
I have any amount of deep feeling. I hide it
on purpose, because you don't like me to show
it, you know you don't! I&mdash;I think you are
very unkind to me."</p>

<p>He reached out his hand and stroked her
hair gently; she was sitting a little away from
him, and he could see the sensitive curve of her
lower lip.</p>

<p>"Don't, child! One never knows how to
take you. Another time you would have seen
that I was only joking."</p>

<p>"You have no right to joke about such a
serious matter. You know it was a serious
matter, now; wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"The most serious in the universe," he
assured her; and he brought his hand gently
down her cheek, and laid it against her throat.</p>

<p>"You are only laughing; you always laugh
at me," she complained; but she bent her
head, and kissed his hand softly. "I feel like
a wolf, sometimes," she added, impetuously.</p>

<p>"Didn't you have enough tea?" he said.
But she knew by his tone that he was not
laughing at her now, and she went on
recklessly.</p>

<p>"I am certain I could not love any one very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
much, without hating him too. It is a horrible
dual feeling that tears one to pieces. Is it
the badness in me, I wonder? Other people
don't seem to feel like that when they are in
love. Why is it?"</p>

<p>"Because it is the same emotion, or set of
emotions, that inspires both love and hatred,"
said Paul. "Circumstance does the rest, or
temperament."</p>

<p>"It is inexplicable," said Katharine solemnly.
"I can understand killing a man, because he
could not understand my love for him; or
casting off my own child, because it was bored
by my affection. I am quite sure," she added,
quaintly, "that I should bore any one in a
week, if I really loved him."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said Paul politely; and they again
laughed away a crisis.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p>At the beginning of October Paul went abroad.
She had thought that life without him would
be unendurable, and she could not analyse her
own feelings when she found that she could
laugh with as much enjoyment as ever, and
that her fits of depression were less frequent
than before. In fact, she had often been far
more unsettled if a letter from him had failed
to arrive when it was due; and a new sensation
of freedom went far to cure her of the restlessness
that had possessed her all the summer.
She began to probe into her truth-loving soul,
to try and discover whether her feeling for him
was not an illusion after all; but she found no
satisfactory explanation of the problem that
was puzzling her, and she put it voluntarily
away from her, and turned to her work as a
healthy antidote. And she had a good deal
of work just then. Thanks to the influence
of the Honourable Mrs. Keeley, her private
pupils were increasing in number, and these,
with her lectures at the school, were producing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
a salary that relieved her of all financial worry
for the present. She was making new friends
too, and it added to her contentment to find
that people asked her to go and see them because
they liked her. For the first time since
her arrival in town, she felt sure of being on
the way to success; and the sensation was a
very thrilling one. Phyllis asked her, one
day, why she was looking so happy. Katharine
laughed, and pondered for a moment; then
answered frankly that she did not know why.
"I only know that I have never been so
gloriously happy in my whole life," she added;
and she wondered, as she spoke, whether the
mad, feverish happiness of the summer months
had really been happiness at all. But Phyllis,
who felt that she had no share in this strange
new life of hers, looked back regretfully on the
earlier days when Katharine had been lonely
and in need of her sympathy. Even Ted told
her she was looking "very fit," and this was
the highest term of praise in his vocabulary.
For, since the beginning of October, she had
seen a good deal of Ted. It was very restful
to come back to him, after the state of high
pressure in which she had been living lately;
and when she grew accustomed to his being a
West-end young man, instead of an easy-going
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
schoolboy, she found him the same delightful
companion as of old. He did not allude to
her many weeks of silence, nor ask her how she
had spent them; he came at her bidding, and
when he found that she liked him to come
he came again. He was as humble as ever,
except in matters of worldly knowledge, and
there he showed a youthful superiority over
her which amused her immensely. His laziness,
which had always been more or less an
assumption with him, had developed into the
fashionable pose of indifference; and she tried
in vain to spur him on to doing something
definite with his life, instead of letting it drift
away in a city office.</p>

<p>"Girls don't understand these things," he
would say with good-natured obstinacy. "Of
course I loathe the beastly hole; any decent
chap would. But I may as well stop there.
It's not my fault that I was ever born, is it?
I get enough to live on, with what my cousin
allows me; and I'm not going to grind all I
know, to get a rise of five bob a week. It
isn't good enough. I'm sure I'm very easily
contented, and my wants are few enough. Oh,
rats! I must have a frock coat; every decent
chap has. And you couldn't possibly call
that extravagant, because I sha'n't think of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
squaring it for a year at least. Of course I
don't expect you to understand these things,
Kitty; it's impossible for a man to do the
cheap, like a woman."</p>

<p>And Katharine, who always wanted to reconstitute
society, with a very limited knowledge
of its first principles, would strike in with a
vigorous denunciation of his comfortable philosophy;
and he would listen and laugh at her,
and make no effort to support his own opinion
which he continued to hold, nevertheless. He
was the best companion she could have had
just then; he never varied, whatever her mood
was, and he kept her from thinking too much
about herself, which was a habit she had acquired
since she last saw him. Besides, he was
a link with her childhood, that period of vague
existence which had held no problems to be
solved, and had never inspired her with a wish
to reform human nature. So they spent many
evenings and half-holidays together, and they
went frequently to the theatre and sat in the
gallery, which often entertained them as much
as the play itself; and he loved to pay for her,
with a manly air, at the box office, and always
made the same kind of weak resistance afterwards,
when Katharine insisted on refunding
her share, under the lamp at the corner of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
Queen's Crescent, Marylebone. Sometimes,
when they were unusually well off, they would
dine at an Italian restaurant first, where they
could have many wonderful dishes for two
shillings, and a bottle of tenpenny claret. On
one occasion&mdash;it was Ted's birthday, and his
cousin had sent him a five-pound note&mdash;they
had more than an ordinary jubilation.</p>

<p>"Buck up, and get ready!" he had rushed
into the little distempered hall to say. "We'll
go to a new place, where the waiters aren't
dirty, and the wine isn't like sulphuric acid.
And, Kitty, put on that hat with the pink
roses, won't you?"</p>

<p>They did their best, on that memorable
evening, to reduce the five pound-note, and
to behave as though they were millionaires.
They drove in a hansom to the restaurant in
question, which was a very brilliant little one
close to the theatres, where they had a waiter
to themselves instead of the fifth part of a
very distracted and breathless one. The state
of Ted's pockets could always be estimated
by the amount of attention he exacted from
the waiter; and this evening there was absolutely
nothing he would do for himself, from
the disposal of his walking stick to the choice
of the wine.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span></p>

<p>"It's a very good tip to start by taking the
waiter into your confidence," he assured Kitty,
when it had just been settled for them that they
were to have <i>bisque</i> soup.</p>

<p>"It's convenient, sometimes, when everything
is written in French," observed Katharine.
Ted changed the conversation. On
his twenty-second birthday he felt inclined,
for once in a way, to assert himself.</p>

<p>"I'm rather gone on this place; pretty,
isn't it?" he continued. "All the candle-shades
are red, white, and blue; mean to say
you didn't twig that? You're getting less
alive every day, Kit! Awfully up-to-date
place, this! I don't suppose there is a single
decent woman in the room, bar yourself."</p>

<p>He said this with such pride in the knowledge,
that she would not have robbed him of
his satisfaction for the world.</p>

<p>"They look much the same as other women
to me," she observed, after a quick survey of
the little tables.</p>

<p>"That's because you don't know. How
should you? Women never do, bless them!
Do you like fizz?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Ted, don't! Isn't it a pity to spend
such a lot just for nothing?" she remonstrated.
She had visions of all the unpaid bills he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
disclosed to her in one of his recent pessimistic
moods.</p>

<p>"My dear Kitty, you really must learn
to enjoy life. Don't be so beastly serious
over everything. Bills? What bills? There
aren't any to-night. The art of living is
knowing when to be extravagant."</p>

<p>And she had to acknowledge, for the rest
of the evening, that he had certainly mastered
the art of living. They went to a music hall,
and sat in the stalls; and Katharine enjoyed
it because Ted was there, and because he was
so funny all through,&mdash;first, in his fear of being
asked by the conjurer for his hat which was a
new one, or his watch which was only represented
by his watch chain; and secondly,
because he tried so hard to distract her attention
from the songs that were inclined to
be risky. And Ted enjoyed it because it
was the thing to do, and because there would
be hardly any of that fiver left by the time
he got home.</p>

<p>"Then you'll look me up at the office at five
to-morrow; you won't forget?" he asked rather
wistfully, when they parted on the doorstep.</p>

<p>"Of course I won't forget," she answered,
hastily. "Dear old Ted, I have enjoyed it
so much!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span></p>

<p>"Good-night, dear," he said, as he turned
away. And his tone haunted her rather, as
she groped her way up to bed in the dark.
She began to feel half afraid, with some annoyance
at the thought, that this pleasant
state of things could not go on for ever, and
that Ted was going to spoil it all again as
he had done once before, by taking their relationship
seriously. So she prepared to meet
him, the next afternoon, with a reserve of
manner that was meant to indicate her displeasure;
but he disconcerted her very much
by asking her bluntly why the dickens she was
playing so poorly; and she felt unreasonably
annoyed to find that her fears were groundless.
So for some time longer they went on
as before, in the same happy-go-lucky kind
of way that had always characterised them.
She learned to know several of his friends,
most of them genuine boyish fellows, who
appealed to her more by their affection for
Ted than by any qualities they possessed
themselves. They seemed very much alike,
though she was bound to acknowledge that
this impression may have been conveyed by
the cut of their clothes and the shape of
their hats, which did not differ by so much as
a hair's breadth. But Ted always shone by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
comparison with the best of them. He was
the only one of his set who did not take
himself seriously; he had a sense of humour,
too, and this compensated for the exhausted
manner which he felt obliged to assume as
a mark of fellowship with them.</p>

<p>He asked her, one night, with some diffidence,
if she would mind coming to tea in his
chambers on the following Sunday.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't think of asking you to come
alone," he hastened to add; "but Monty is
going to bring his sister along, so that's all
square as long as you don't mind."</p>

<p>"Mind! Why, of course not," said Katharine,
in frank astonishment. "What is there
to mind? I want to see your chambers very
much. I have often wondered why you never
asked me before."</p>

<p>Ted stared at her for a moment, and then
began tracing what remained of the pattern in
the linoleum with his walking stick. They
were standing, as usual, in the hall of number
ten, Queen's Crescent.</p>

<p>"What a babe you are, Kitty!" he said, without
looking up; and Katharine reddened as
she suddenly realised his meaning. Of course
Ted was no longer a boy, and she was no
longer a child; and she was on precisely the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
same footing with him in the eyes of the
world as she was with Paul Wilton. Unconsciously,
she compared the attitude of the two
men under similar circumstances; Paul, who
was unscrupulous in letting her visit him as
long as no one knew of it; and Ted, who had
no views on the matter at all but merely wished
to spare her any annoyance.</p>

<p>"I see," she said. "Who is Monty?" She
always felt nervous when he offered to introduce
her to any of his friends; because she
knew very well that he warned them all beforehand
that she had "ideas," and this put her at
a distinct disadvantage to begin with.</p>

<p>"Oh, Monty's awfully smart! He knows
no end. You'll like Monty, I expect. He
wants to meet you, awfully; says he likes the
look of your photograph. I told him how
bally clever you were, and all that. Monty's
clever, too; he reads Ibsen."</p>

<p>Katharine received this proof of Monty's
intellectual ability with some cynicism which,
however, she was careful to conceal.</p>

<p>"I shall be delighted to meet him," she said.
"What time shall I come?"</p>

<p>"Oh, any time; four will do. And, I say,
Kit, I suppose I must have cream, mustn't I?
You can't give Monty milk that's been sitting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
for hours, and spoof him that it's cream. I've
done that sometimes, but you can't spoof
Monty."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll bring the cream. I know a shop
where they'll let me have it on Sunday," said
Katharine confidently; and Ted left comforted.</p>

<p>After all, Monty's sister could not come;
but Ted's sense of the fitness of things was
satisfied by his having asked her, and, as
Monty himself came and did not seem afraid
of Katharine as all his other friends were, he
felt that his tea-party was a success. The only
thing that marred his enjoyment was the fact
that Katharine, for some unaccountable caprice,
refused to be intellectual in spite of the efforts
of Monty, whose real name proved to be Montague,
to draw her out. Monty was a young
man with a gentlemanly view of life, tempered
by a great desire to be thought advanced; and
he began the conversation with a will.</p>

<p>"Awfully clever new thing at the Royalty!
Suppose you've seen it, Miss Austen?" he
began. "Awfully plucky of the Independent
Theatre to put it on, it is really."</p>

<p>"Is it?" smiled Katharine. "I haven't
seen it yet. Ted and I hate those advanced
plays,&mdash;they're so slow as a rule. Comic
operas, we like best."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span></p>

<p>Monty seemed surprised; and Ted was a
little disconcerted by this frank avowal of his
own ordinary tastes.</p>

<p>"You see, Kit only goes to those things to
please me," he said, apologetically. "She's
just as keen on all those humpy plays as you
are, don't you know?"</p>

<p>Monty was not sure that he knew, but he
turned to another branch of art.</p>

<p>"Talking about posters," he said,&mdash;which was
only his favourite method of opening a conversation,
for nobody was talking about posters at
all,&mdash;"have you seen that awfully clever one of
the new paper, 'The Future'? It's by quite
a new man, in the French style, so bold and
yet so subtle. But of course you must have
seen it."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," laughed Katharine, "I should
think I had! You mean the red one, don't
you, with a black sun and a cactus thing, and
a lot of spots all over it? Ted and I were
laughing at it, only yesterday. Do you really
think it is good?"</p>

<p>Monty said he really did think so; and Ted,
who was torn in two by his admiration for both
of them, came to his rescue.</p>

<p>"You had better be careful, Kitty," he said,
anxiously. "Monty does know."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course," said Katharine politely, "it is
only a matter of taste, isn't it, Mr. Montague?"</p>

<p>"Quite so," replied Monty, concealing his
feelings of superiority as well as he could.
"By the way, talking of taste, what do you
think of the new Danish poet? Rather strong,
don't you think?"</p>

<p>Katharine sighed, and glanced nervously at
Ted.</p>

<p>"Oh, I suppose he's all right," she said,
with the exaggerated solemnity that would have
betrayed to any one who knew her well how
close she was to laughter; "but he isn't a bit
new, is he? I mean, he only says the same
things over again that the old poets said ever
so much better. Don't you think so?"</p>

<p>"They all give you the hump, any way,"
put in Ted. But Monty ignored his remark,
and said that he never read any of the old
poets; he preferred the new ones because they
went so much deeper.</p>

<p>"Hang it all, Kitty; what a rum girl you
are!" said Ted, in a disappointed tone. "A
chap never knows where to have you. I did
think you were advanced, if you couldn't be
anything else."</p>

<p>At this point, Katharine yielded to an irresistible
desire to laugh; and Ted looked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
anxiously at the friend to whom he had given
such a false impression of her "ideas." But,
to his surprise, the great Monty himself joined
in her laughter, and seemed inexpressibly
relieved to find that she was not nearly so
intellectual as she had been painted, and it was
therefore no longer incumbent on him to sustain
the conversation at such a high pitch.</p>

<p>"Now that we have settled I am not
advanced," said Katharine, turning up her
veil, "supposing we have some tea." And
for the rest of the afternoon they behaved like
rational beings, and discussed the low comedians
and the comic papers.</p>

<p>"All the same," Ted complained, when
Monty had gone, "he's awfully clever, really.
You may rot as much as you like, but Monty
does know about things. You don't know
what a fool he makes <i>me</i> feel."</p>

<p>"He needn't do that," said Katharine. "It
would be the kindest thing in the world not
to let him read another magazine or newspaper
for six months. I think he is very nice,
though, when he lets himself go."</p>

<p>Ted looked at her a little sadly.</p>

<p>"You seemed to be getting on beastly well,
I thought," he said.</p>

<p>"He is certainly very amusing, and it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
nice of you to ask me to meet him," continued
Katharine, innocently. Ted walked to the fire-place,
and studied himself silently in the looking-glass.</p>

<p>"I wish I wasn't such a damned fool," he
burst out savagely. Katharine stood still with
amazement.</p>

<p>"Ted!" she cried. "Ted! What do you
mean?"</p>

<p>Ted planted his elbows on the mantel-shelf,
and buried his face in his hands.</p>

<p>"Ted!" she said again, with distress in her
voice. "What do you mean, Ted? As if I&mdash;oh,
Ted! And a man like <i>that</i>! You know
piles more than he does, old boy, ever so much
more. You don't put on any side, that's all;
and he does. You mustn't say that any more,
Ted; oh, you mustn't! It hurts."</p>

<p>"You know you are spoofing me," he said, in
muffled tones. "You know you only say that
just to please me. You think I am a fool all
the time, only you are a good old brick and
pretend not to see it. As if I didn't twig! I
ought never to have been born."</p>

<p>Katharine walked swiftly over to him, and
laid her hand on his arm. She did not reason
with herself; she only knew that she wanted
to comfort him at any price.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span></p>

<p>"Ted," she said, earnestly, "<i>I</i> am glad you
were born."</p>

<p>He turned round suddenly, and looked at
her; and she started nervously at the eagerness
of his expression. He had not looked like
that when he made love to her in the summer-house.</p>

<p>"Do you mean that, dear?"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't be so serious, Ted! Of course
I mean it; of course I am glad you were
born. Think how forlorn I should have been
without you; it would have been awful if I
had been alone." He looked only half satisfied;
and she went on desperately, caring for
nothing but to charm away the miserable look
from his face. "Dear Ted, you know what
you are to me; you know I don't care a little
bit for Monty, or anybody else, either."</p>

<p>"Do you mean that, Kitty?" he asked
again, in a voice that he could not steady.
"Not anybody else, dear?"</p>

<p>Something indefinable, something that made
her long for another man's voice to be trembling
for love of her, as his was trembling now,
seemed to come between them and to strike
her dumb. He looked at her searchingly for
a moment, then shook off her hand and pushed
her away from him. She shivered as the suspicion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
crossed her mind that he had guessed her
thoughts, though she knew quite well that the
renewal of her friendship with Paul was unknown
to him. She went up to him again, and
let him seize her two hands and crush them
until she could have cried out with the pain.</p>

<p>"You are the best fellow in the world, Ted,"
she said. "But you mustn't look like that;
oh, don't! I am not worth it, Ted; I am not
nearly good enough for you, dear,&mdash;you know
I am not. I am never going to marry any one;
I am not the sort to marry; I am hard, and
cold, and bitter. Sometimes, I think I shall
just work and fight my way to the end. I
know I shall never be happy in the way most
women are happy. But I will be your chum,
and stick to you always, Ted. May I?"</p>

<p>"Oh, shut up!" said Ted, almost in a
whisper; and the tears sprang to her eyes.
She stood on tiptoe, and impetuously kissed
the only place on his cheek she could reach.
At the moment, it seemed the only right and
proper thing to be done.</p>

<p>"I couldn't help it. I had to; and I
don't care," she said, defiantly. And Ted
wrung her hands again, and let them go.</p>

<p>"I suppose none of it is your fault, Kit,
but&mdash;"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span></p>

<p>There was a pause, and Katharine avoided
his eyes, for the first time in her life.</p>

<p>"It's time to go," she said. "Will you see
me home?"</p>

<p>She fetched him his hat and coat, and Ted
gave himself a shake.</p>

<p>"He didn't take cream, after all," he said,
with a poor attempt at a laugh.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p>A letter came from Paul, just before Christmas,
to say that he was going to remain at Monte
Carlo for another month. Knowing his passion
for warmth and sunshine, she was not
surprised; she was hardly even disappointed.
She began to wonder what her feelings would
have been if he had decided to remain another
year instead of another month; and again she
was obliged to own that the solution of her
own state of mind was beyond her. The
Keeleys went abroad about the same time,
which took away her chief centre of amusement;
and her former mood of satisfaction
was succeeded by one of serene indifference, in
which she continued until she went home for
the holidays. At Ivingdon the dulness of
four weeks, passed almost entirely in the company
of her father and Miss Esther, caused the
old unsatisfied feeling to return to her; and
she longed for a vent for the restless energy that
wore her out as long as there was no work to
be done. She grew impatient once more for a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
glimpse of Paul Wilton, for the touch of his
thin, nervous hand, and the sound of his
quiet, unemotional voice; and she acted over
and over again, in her mind, how they would
meet once more in the little room overlooking
Fountain Court, what he would be
sure to say to her, and what she knew she
would say to him. No letter came from
Paul all through those weary days, and
she only wrote to him once. The pathetic
note was very prominent in that one letter,
and she consoled herself with her own unhappiness
while she awaited the answer to it;
but when no answer came her pride revolted,
and she wished passionately that she had never
sent it.</p>

<p>"Can't you stay another week, child?" said
Miss Esther, as the end of the holidays drew
near. "You don't look much better than
when you came, though it's not to be expected
you should, working away as you do. I never
heard such nonsense, and all to no purpose!
When I was a girl&mdash;&nbsp;But there, what's the
use?"</p>

<p>And Katharine, who had heard it all before,
explained over again with increasing impatience
that her work was a definite thing and
required her presence on a certain day. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
had never felt less pleased with herself than on
the day of her departure, when she left the
home that had once been the whole world to
her, and took leave of the people who no
longer believed in her. But as she neared
London a sensation of coming events dispelled
the atmosphere of disapproval which had been
stifling her for a whole month, and she once
more felt the mistress of her own situation
and her own future. Here was life and
activity, work and success, and some of it
was going to be hers. And Paul Wilton
would soon be coming home again. They
told her at Queen's Crescent how well she
was looking, when she appeared in the dining-room
at tea-time; and she laughed back in
reply as she contrasted their greeting with her
aunt's farewell words.</p>

<p>"Just a year since I first came," she said to
Phyllis. "What a lot has happened since then!
I don't believe it was myself at all; it must
have been somebody else. Oh, I am glad I
am different now!"</p>

<p>"I remember," said Phyllis, who never
rhapsodised. "Your face was smutty after
your journey, and you looked as though you
would kill any one who spoke to you."</p>

<p>"And you were eating bread and treacle,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
retorted Katharine. "Let's have some now,
shall we?"</p>

<p>"By the way," said Phyllis presently,
"there's a letter for you upstairs. It came
about a week ago, and I clean forgot to forward
it. I'm awfully sorry, but I don't suppose it
matters much because it's got a foreign post-mark."</p>

<p>The laughter died out of Katharine's face,
as she put down her teacup and stared speechlessly
at her friend.</p>

<p>"Shall I go and fetch it?" continued the
unconscious Phyllis, as she deluged her last
morsel of bread with more treacle than any
force of cohesion would allow it to hold.
"Perhaps you're ready to come up yourself,
though? I've prepared a glorification for you&mdash;Hullo!
what are you in such a desperate
hurry about?"</p>

<p>When she arrived breathless at the top of the
house, Katharine was already in her cubicle,
turning everything over in a wild and fruitless
search.</p>

<p>"Go away!" she said shortly, when Phyllis
came in. "It was the only thing I asked you
to do, and I thought I could trust you. I
shall know better another time. What are all
these things doing here?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span></p>

<p>She knocked her head, as she spoke, against
a string of Chinese lanterns. There were
flowers on the mantel-shelf, and a look of festivity
in the dingy little room; but it was all
lost on Katharine, who continued to open and
shut the drawers with trembling hands, and to
search in every likely place for her letter, until
Phyllis put an end to her aimless task by
bringing it to her in eloquent silence. Then
she stole away again; and Katharine sat down in
the midst of the confusion she had created, and
became absorbed in its contents. It was very
short, and there was hardly any news in it that
could not have been extracted from a guide-book;
but she spent quite half an hour in reading
it and pondering over it, until she knew
every one of its stilted phrases by heart. He
was very well and it was very hot, and he was
sitting by the open window looking down on the
orange groves, and the sea was a splendid colour,
and there were some very decent people in the
hotel, and amongst them her relations the Keeleys.
It was hard to look up at last, with dazed
eyes, and to discover that she was in Queen's
Crescent, Marylebone, instead of being where
her thoughts were, in the sunny South of France.</p>

<p>"Hullo," said Phyllis, who was standing at
the end of the bed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes?" said Katharine, smiling. "Do
you want anything?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said Phyllis, and crept away
again. Katharine sat and pondered a little
while longer. Presently, she shivered and
made the discovery that she was cold, and
she jumped up and stretched herself.</p>

<p>"I suppose I must unpack," she said, still
smiling contentedly. "Where has Phyllis
gone, I wonder?"</p>

<p>She went to the door and made the passage
ring with her voice, until Phyllis hurried
out of a neighbouring room and apologised
for not being there when she was wanted.</p>

<p>"I believe you were there when I didn't
want you," said Katharine candidly. "Wasn't
I cross to you or something?" Her foot
touched one of the discarded Chinese lanterns.</p>

<p>"Hullo! I thought there were some lanterns
somewhere. Where are they gone?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" said Phyllis, going down on her
knees before the box. "You must have been
dreaming."</p>

<p>"I wasn't dreaming, and you're a foolish
old dear, and I am a selfish pig," cried Katharine
penitently.</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" said Phyllis again. "I was the
pig, you see, because I forgot your letter.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
You'll rumple my hair, if you do that
again."</p>

<p>Katharine did hug her again, nevertheless,
and accused herself of all the offences she
could remember, whether they related to the
present occasion or not; and Phyllis silenced
her in a gruff voice, and the unpacking proceeded
by degrees.</p>

<p>"Don't you think," said Katharine irrelevantly,
"that women are much more selfish
than men, in some ways?"</p>

<p>"What ways?"</p>

<p>"I mean when they are absorbed in anything.
Now, a man wouldn't behave like a
cad to his best friend, just because he happened
to be in love with a girl, would he?
But a woman would. She would betray her
nearest and dearest for the sake of a man. I
am certain I should. Women are so wolfish,
directly they feel things; and they seem to lose
their sense of honour when they fall in love.
Don't they?"</p>

<p>"Where do the stockings go?" was all
Phyllis said.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," continued Katharine, "it is because
a woman really has stronger feelings than
a man."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't wonder," said Phyllis. "Who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
packed the sponge bag next to your best
hat?"</p>

<p>"I don't think it matters," said Katharine
mildly. "I was saying&mdash;&nbsp;What are you
laughing at?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. Only, it is so delightful to
have you back again, moralising away while
I do all the work," laughed Phyllis.</p>

<p>Katharine owned humbly that Phyllis always
did all the work, and Phyllis bluntly repudiated
the charge, and insisted that Katharine
was the most unselfish person in the world,
and Katharine ended in allowing herself to be
persuaded that she was; and the rest of the
evening passed in an amicable exchange of
news. Even the "cat in the pie dish" seemed
appetising that evening.</p>

<p>Her feeling of satisfaction was increased
when she arrived at school the next morning
and found that Mrs. Downing was anxious to
speak to her. An interview with the lady
principal at the beginning of term generally
foreboded some good.</p>

<p>"I want you to give up the junior teaching
this term, my dear Miss Austen," she began,
after greeting her warmly. "You are really
too good for it, far too good. Mr. Wilton
was quite right when he told me how cultured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
you were, quite right. At the time, I must
confess to feeling very doubtful; you seemed
so inexperienced,&mdash;so very young, in fact.
But I have come to think that in your case it
is no drawback to be young; indeed, the dear
children seem to prefer it. Their attachment
for you is extraordinary; pardon me, I should
have said phenomenal. And the way you
manage them is perfect, quite perfect,&mdash;just
the touch of firmness to show that your kindness
is not weakness. Admirable! I am most
grateful to Mr. Wilton for introducing you
to me, most grateful. Such a charming man,
is he not? So distinguished!"</p>

<p>She paused for breath, and Katharine murmured
an acknowledgment of Mr. Wilton's
distinction.</p>

<p>"To come to the point, my dear Miss Austen,
I should be charmed, quite charmed, if
you would take the senior work this term,&mdash;English
in all its branches, French translation,
Latin, and drawing. I think you know the
curriculum, do you not? Thank you very
much; that is so good of you! Did you have
a pleasant holiday? There is no need to ask
how you are,&mdash;the very picture of health, I am
sure! And the architecture lectures, too; I
should be more than grateful if you would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
continue them as before. Thank you so
much&mdash;&nbsp;Ah, I beg your pardon?"</p>

<p>Katharine here made a desperate inroad
into the torrent of words, and mentioned that
she knew no Latin and had never taught any
drawing.</p>

<p>"Indeed? But you are too modest, my
dear Miss Austen; it is your one failing, if
I may say so. Of course, if you wish&mdash;then
let it be so. But I am convinced you would
do both as well as Miss Smithson, quite convinced.
However, that can easily be arranged.
The salary I think you know, and the lectures
will be as before. Indeed, we are most fortunate
to have so delightful a lecturer, most
fortunate. Ah, there is one more thing," continued
Mrs. Downing, leading her towards the
door. The rest of her speech was said on the
landing which happened, fortunately, to be
empty. "This is between ourselves, my dear
Miss Austen,&mdash;quite between ourselves. I
should be more than grateful if you would act
as chaperon to the music master this term.
It may appear strange that I should ask you
to do this,&mdash;indeed, I may say peculiar; but I
do so in the conviction that I can trust you
better than any one else. Of course you will
not mention what I have said! I am sure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
you understand what I mean. That is so
charming of you! Thank you so much!"</p>

<p>And the lady principal returned to say very
much the same thing over again to the next
teacher whom she summoned. But Katharine,
who had long since learnt to regard her insincerity
as inevitable, merely congratulated herself
on the practical results of her interview,
and thoroughly enjoyed the contest that ensued
when her new pupils found they were going to
be taught by a junior mistress. She felt very
elated when she came out of it victorious; and
for the next week or two everything seemed to
go well with her. She had made a position for
herself, although every one had told her it would
be impossible; there were people who believed
in her thoroughly, and there were others, like
Ted and Phyllis Hyam, who did not understand
her but worshipped her blindly. It
was all very gratifying to her, after the dull
month she had spent at home; and for the
first time she threw off the reserve she
usually showed, though unconsciously, towards
the working gentlewomen of Queen's Crescent,
and talked about herself in a way that
astonished them not a little. Work to them
was a sordid necessity, and they were a little
jealous of this brilliant girl, with the youth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
and the talent, who found no difficulty in
winning success where they had barely earned
a living, and who seemed to enjoy her life
into the bargain.</p>

<p>"Who is that girl with the jolly laugh and
the untidy hair?" she overheard a stranger
asking Polly Newland one day.</p>

<p>"That one?" was the reply, given in a
contemptuous tone. "Oh, she's a caution,
I can tell you! Nice? Oh, I dare say!
She's a prig, though. Phyllis Hyam&mdash;that's
the other girl in our room&mdash;thinks all
the world of her; but I can't stand prigs,
myself."</p>

<p>It was a little shock to her self-esteem to
hear herself described so baldly, though she consoled
herself by the reflection that Polly had
never liked her, and there was consequently
very little value to be attached to her opinion.
But she was careful to remain silent about her
own affairs for the next day or two; and she
startled Ted, one evening, by asking him suddenly,
between the acts of a melodrama, what
was meant by a "prig."</p>

<p>"A prig? Oh, I don't know! It's the
same thing as a smug, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"But what is a smug?"</p>

<p>"Well, of course, a smug is&mdash;well, he's a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
smug, I suppose. He hasn't got to be anything
else, has he? He's a played-out sort of
bounder, who wants to have a good time and
hasn't the pluck, don't you know?"</p>

<p>"Are all prigs bounders?" asked Katharine,
in a voice of dismay.</p>

<p>"Oh, I expect so! It doesn't matter, does
it? At least, there's a chap in our office who
is a bit of a prig, and he isn't a bounder exactly.
He's a very decent sort of chap, really;
I don't half mind him, myself. But they
always call him a prig because he goes in for
being so mighty saintly; at least, that's what
they say. I don't think he is so bad as all
that, myself."</p>

<p>"Is it priggish to be good, then? I thought
one ought to try."</p>

<p>"My dear Kit, of course you are a girl;
don't worry yourself about it. It's altogether
different for a girl, don't you see?"</p>

<p>"Then girls are never prigs?" said Katharine
eagerly.</p>

<p>"Bless their hearts," said Ted vaguely; and
she did not get any further definition from him
that evening.</p>

<p>And so the days grew into weeks, and her
life became filled with new interests, and she
told herself she was learning to live at last.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
But she had her bad days, as well; and on
these she felt that something was still wanting
in her life. And the end of February came,
and Paul Wilton had not yet returned to his
chambers in Essex Court.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p>The courts had just risen, and the barristers in
their wigs and gowns were hastening through
the Temple on the way to their various chambers.
It was not a day on which to linger, for
a pitiless east wind swept across Fountain
Court, making little eddies in the basin of
water where the goldfish swam, and swirling
the dust into little sandstorms to blind the
shivering people who were using the thoroughfare
down to the Embankment. The city
clocks were chiming the quarter after four, as
Paul Wilton came along with the precise and
measured step that never varied whatever the
weather might be, and mounted the wooden
staircase that led to his rooms. A man rose
from his easiest chair as he walked into his sitting-room,
and they greeted one another in the
cordial though restrained manner of men who
had not met for some time.</p>

<p>"Sorry you've been waiting, Heaton. Been
here long?" said Paul, throwing off his gown
with more rapidity than he usually showed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, no matter; my fault for getting here
too early," returned Heaton cheerily, as he sat
down again and pulled his chair closer to the
fire. He never entered anybody's house without
making elaborate preparations to stay a
long while.</p>

<p>"Fact is," he continued, "it's so long since
I saw you that, directly I heard you were back,
I felt I must come round and look you up.
It was young Linton who told me,&mdash;you remember
Linton? Ran across him in the club,
last night; he knows some friends of yours,&mdash;Kerry,
or Keeley, or some such name as that;
just been calling on them, apparently, and they
told him you had travelled back with them.
Suppose you know the people I mean?"</p>

<p>Paul admitted that he knew the people he
had been travelling with, and Heaton rattled
on afresh.</p>

<p>"We were talking about you at the club,
only the other afternoon; coincidence, wasn't
it? Two or three of us,&mdash;Marston, and Hallett,
and old Pryor. You remember old Pryor,
don't you? Stock Exchange, and swears a lot&mdash;ah,
you know; he wanted to know what
had become of you and your damned career;
it was a damned pity for the most brilliant
man at the bar, and the only one with a conscience,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
to be wasted on a lot of damned foreigners,
and so on. You know old Pryor.
Of course I agreed with him, but it wasn't my
business to say so."</p>

<p>He paused a little wistfully, as though he
expected Paul to say something to explain his
long absence; but the latter only smiled slightly,
and walked across to his cupboard in the
corner.</p>

<p>"I'm going to have some tea," he observed,
"but I don't expect you to join me in that,
Heaton. There's some vermuth here, Italian
vermuth; or, of course, you can have whiskey
if you prefer it."</p>

<p>"Thanks, my boy," laughed the other.
"I'm glad to see that five months in the infernal
regions haven't spoilt your memory.
Claret for boys, brandy for heroes, eh?"</p>

<p>He helped himself to whiskey, and then
leaned back in his chair to survey Paul, who
was making a cigarette while the water boiled.
There was one of the long silences that were
inevitable with Paul, unless his companion took
the initiative; and for the next five minutes
the only sounds to be heard were the singing
of the kettle, the rise and fall of footsteps in
the court below, and the occasional rattle of
the window sash as the wind wrestled with it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
Paul made the tea, and brought his cup to the
table, and flung himself at full length on the
sofa beside it.</p>

<p>"Well," he said at last, "haven't you any
news to tell me? Who is the last charming
lady you have been trotting round to all the
picture galleries,&mdash;the one who is more beautiful,
and more intellectual, and more sympathetic
than any woman you have ever met?"</p>

<p>Heaton laughed consciously.</p>

<p>"Now, it's odd you should happen to say
that," he said in his simple manner. "Of
course I know it's only your chaff, confound
you, but there <i>is</i> just a smattering of truth in
it. By Jove, Wilton, you must come and
meet her; you never saw such a figure, and
she's the wittiest creature I ever ran across!
I'm nowhere, when it comes to talk; but she's
so kind to me, Wilton,&mdash;you can't think; I
never met such a sympathetic woman. Really,
she has the most extraordinary effect upon me;
I haven't been so influenced by any woman
since poor little May died, 'pon my word I
haven't. I can't think how it's all going to
end, I tell you I can't. It's giving me a lot
of worry, I know."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Paul gravely. "Widow?"</p>

<p>"Her husband was a brute," said Heaton
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
energetically. "Colonel in the army, drank,
used her villainously I expect, though she
doesn't say much; she's awfully staunch to
the chap. Women are, you know; I can't
think why, when we treat them so badly.
That's where they get their hold over us, I
suppose. But her influence over me is wonderful.
I wouldn't do anything to lose her
respect, for the world."</p>

<p>He blinked his eyes, and drank some more
whiskey. Perhaps it occurred to him that
his companion was even less responsive than
usual, for there was more vigour and less
sentiment in his tone when he resumed the
conversation.</p>

<p>"You never tell me anything about yourself,"
he complained, rather pathetically. "You
draw me out, and I'm ass enough to be drawn;
and then you sit and smile cynically, while I
make a fool of myself. How about <i>your</i> experiences,
eh? 'Pon my word, I don't remember
a single instance of your giving me
your confidence! You're such a rum, reserved
sort of chap. Well, I dare say you're
right to keep it all to yourself. It does me
good to tell things; but then, I'm different."</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, I've nothing to tell,"
replied Paul, smiling. "You forget that my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
life is not full of the charming experiences that
seem to fall so continually to your lot. And
your conversation is so much more interesting
than mine would be, that I prefer to listen;
that's all. I'm not secretive; I have merely
nothing to secrete."</p>

<p>"That's all very well," said Heaton, shaking
his head; "but I'm older than you, so that
won't wash. You should have heard what those
fellows at the club were saying about you."</p>

<p>"Yes? It doesn't interest me in the least,"
said Paul coldly. But tact was not the strong
point of his friend's character, and he went
on, notwithstanding.</p>

<p>"Of course I didn't say much,&mdash;it isn't my
way; besides, you know I think you're always
right in the main. But it's enough to make
fellows talk, when a man like you, who always
sets his career before his pleasure, goes away
out of the vacation, and stays away all these
months. You must own it's reasonable to
speculate a little; it's only in man's nature."</p>

<p>"Some men's," said Paul, as coldly as
before. "I should never dream of speculating
about anybody's course of action, myself."</p>

<p>"No, no, of course not; I quite agree with
you, quite," said Heaton. "By the way," he
added, with bland innocence in his expression,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
"what sort of people are these Kerrys you
have been travelling with? An old married
couple of sorts, I suppose!"</p>

<p>Paul raised himself on his elbow and drank
his tea straight off, as though he had not heard
the question. He was always divided, in his
conversations with Heaton, between a desire
to snub him and a fear of wounding his sensitiveness.</p>

<p>"You haven't told me the charming widow's
name," he said, dropping back into his former
position. The other man's face brightened,
and the conversation again became a monologue
until even Heaton's prosiness was exhausted,
and silence fell upon them both.
And then, very characteristically, as soon as
he was quite sure he was not expected to say
anything, Paul suddenly became communicative.</p>

<p>"The Keeleys are rather nice people," he
observed, taking his cigarette out of his mouth
and staring fixedly at the lighted end of it.
"Mother and daughter, you know, just abroad
for the winter. Nice little place in Herefordshire,
I believe, but they come to town for
the season,&mdash;Curzon Street."</p>

<p>Heaton was wise enough to remain silent;
and Paul went on, after a pause.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span></p>

<p>"Sat next to them at table d'hôte, and that
sort of thing. One is always glad of a compatriot
abroad, don't you know! And the
mother was really rather nice," he added, as an
afterthought.</p>

<p>"And what was the daughter like?" asked
Heaton.</p>

<p>"Oh, just an ordinary amusing sort of girl!
She's pretty, too, in a sort of way, but I don't
admire that kind of thing much, myself. And
I think she found me very dull." He paused,
and looked thoughtful. "I must take you
there when they come up to town, Heaton.
You'd get on with them, and the girl is just
your style, I fancy. She is really very pretty,"
he added, becoming thoughtful again.</p>

<p>"Nothing I should like better! Delightful
of you to think of it!" exclaimed Heaton,
with a warmth that was a little overdone. His
want of a sense of proportion was always an
annoyance to Paul. "You take me there,
that's all," he said, chuckling; "and let me
have my head&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Which is precisely what you wouldn't
have," said Paul drily. "And I'm sure I
don't know why you want to know them;
they are quite ordinary people, and don't
possess every grace and virtue and talent,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
like all your other lady friends. However,
I shall be very pleased if you really care
about it. But you'll be disappointed."</p>

<p>Heaton agreed to be disappointed, and as
another pause seemed imminent, he began to
think about taking his departure. But Paul
did not notice his intention, and seized the
occasion to start a new subject.</p>

<p>"Look here, Heaton," he began, so suddenly
that the elder man sat down again with
precision; "you say I never tell you anything
about my experiences. Does that mean
that you really think I have anything to tell?"</p>

<p>Heaton looked at him dubiously.</p>

<p>"I'm hanged if I know," he said.</p>

<p>Paul smiled, a little regretfully.</p>

<p>"After years of renunciation," he murmured,
"to be merely accounted a riddle!
Then you think," he continued, with an interested
expression, "that I am not the sort of
man women would care about, eh? Well, I
dare say you're right. But then, why do
they ever care for any of us? I never expect
them to, personally."</p>

<p>Heaton was looking at him in a perplexed
manner.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I didn't express myself quite
clearly," he hastened to say, with his usual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
wish to compromise. "I only meant that I
sometimes think you never can have cared for
any one seriously. But I've no doubt I'm
wrong. And I never said that nobody had
ever cared for <i>you</i>; I think that's extremely
unlikely. In fact&mdash;&nbsp;Do you really want me
to say what I think?"</p>

<p>"It would be most interesting," said Paul,
still smiling.</p>

<p>"Well," said Heaton decidedly, "I think
you're the sort of man who would break a
woman's heart and spare her reputation, and
perhaps not discover that she liked you at all.
I know what women are, and they just love to
pine away for a man like you who would never
dream of giving them any encouragement.
And you have such a fascinating way with you
that you just lead them on, without meaning
to in the least. You can curse, if you like,
Wilton; it's great impertinence on my part,
eh?"</p>

<p>"My dear fellow," was all Paul said. As a
matter of fact, he had never liked him better
than he did at that moment, and his words had
set him thinking. But Heaton's next remark
undid the good impression he had unwittingly
made.</p>

<p>"The fact is," he said, "a woman's reputation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
is worth only half as much to her as her
happiness."</p>

<p>And his worldly wisdom jarred on Paul's
nerves, and sounded unnecessarily coarse to
him in his present mood; and he did not try
to detain him again, when Heaton rose for the
second time to take his leave. When he had
gone, Paul strolled to the window-seat and
smoked another cigarette, looking down into
the wind-swept court. And his thoughts deliberately
turned to Katharine Austen. He
had not seen her for five months, he had not
written to her for two, and her last letter to
him was dated six weeks back. It had not
occurred to him, until he drew it from his
pocket now and looked at it, that it was really
so long as that since she had written to him;
and he became suddenly possessed of a wish to
know what those six weeks had held for her.
Out there in the orange groves of the South,
walking by the side of the beautiful Marion
Keeley, with the rustle of her skirts so close to
him and the shallow levity of her conversation
in his ears, it had been easy to forget the desperately
earnest child who was toiling away to
earn her living in the dullest quarter of a dull
city. But here, where she had so often sat and
talked to him, where they had loved to quarrel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
and to make it up again, where she had given
him rare glimpses of her quaint self and then
hastily hidden it from him again, where she
had been whimsical and serious by turns,
where he had sometimes kissed her and felt
her cheek warm at his touch,&mdash;here, all sorts of
memories rushed back into his mind, and made
him wonder why he had yielded so easily to
the persuasions of the Keeleys, and remained
so long away from England. It was impossible
to name Marion Keeley in the same
breath with this curiously lovable child who
had held him in her sway all last summer, who
had never used an art to draw him to her, and
yet had succeeded, by force of qualities that she
did not know she possessed, in gaining his
sincere affection. Yet he had hardly thought
of her for two months, and she had not written
to him for six weeks. What had she been
doing in those six weeks? It had not seemed
to matter, when he walked by the side of
Marion Keeley, how Katharine was passing her
time in London; but now that Marion was no
longer near him, now that he was free from her
fascination and the necessity of replying to her
banalities, it suddenly became of the first importance
to him to know what had happened
to Katharine in those six weeks. He had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
gone away, he told himself, because he had
taken fright at the situation, because he could
not analyse his own feelings for her, because
everything, in the eyes of the world, was hurrying
them on to marriage,&mdash;and of marriage he
had the profoundest dread. And he had allowed
himself to be captivated almost immediately,
by the ordinary beauty of an ordinary
girl, someone who knew how to play upon a
certain set of his emotions which Katharine
had never learnt to touch. An expression of
distaste crossed his face as he threw away his
cigarette only half smoked, and looked down
at the fountain as he had so often stood and
looked with her in the hot days of last July.
Heaton's words returned to his mind with a
new significance: "Their reputation is worth
only half as much to them as their happiness."
He remembered how he had parted from
Katharine in this very room, before he went
abroad; and how he had congratulated himself
afterwards on having refrained from kissing
her. But he had a sudden recollection now
of the look on her face as she turned away
from him; and, for the first time, he thought
he understood its meaning.</p>

<p>He had never acted on an impulse in his life,
before, nor yielded to a wish he could not analyse;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
but this afternoon he did both. It was
about an hour later that Phyllis Hyam strolled
into Katharine's cubicle with the announcement
that a gentleman was in the hall, waiting to
speak to her.</p>

<p>"Bother!" grumbled Katharine, who was
correcting exercises on the bed. "He never
said he was coming to-night."</p>

<p>"It isn't Mr. Morton," volunteered Phyllis,
from behind her own curtain. "I've never seen
him before. He's tall, and thin, and serious
looking, with a leathery sort of face, and a dear
little fizzly beard."</p>

<p>She made a few more gratuitous remarks on
the gentleman in the hall, until she began to
wonder why she received no reply to them,
and then made the discovery that the occupant
of the neighbouring cubicle was no longer
there.</p>

<p>Paul was already regretting his impulse. He
had never been inside the little distempered
hall before, and it struck a feeling of chill into
him. A good many girls came in at the door
while he was waiting, and they all stared at him
inquiringly, and most of them were dull looking.
He remembered the sumptuous house in
Mayfair that would soon contain Marion Keeley,
and he shuddered a little.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't think I should like to live with
working-women much," he said, when Katharine
came running down the wooden stairs.</p>

<p>It was the only remark that came easily to
him, when he felt the warm clasp of her hand
and saw the glad look in her eyes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p>She was looking rather tired, he thought,
when he examined her more critically; her
eyes seemed larger, and her expression had
grown restless, and she had lost some of the
roundness of her face. But she had gained a
good deal in repose of manner; and her voice,
when she answered him, was more under
control at the moment than his own.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't think you would," she laughed.
"I shocked them all at breakfast, this morning,
by saying I should like to try idle men
for a change!"</p>

<p>It struck him that she would not have
made such a remark when he left her last
autumn; and again he would have liked
to possess a chronicle of the last six weeks.
But her laugh was the same as ever, and her
hand was still grasping his with a reassuring
fervour.</p>

<p>"Come back with me," he said, spontaneously.
"We can't talk here, can we? I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
dare say I can knock up some sort of a supper
for you, if you don't mind a very primitive
arrangement."</p>

<p>"It will be beautiful," she said; and the
throb of pleasure in her voice allayed his last
feeling of suspicion.</p>

<p>They found that, after all, they had very
little to say to one another; and they were
both glad of the occupation of preparing supper,
when they arrived at the Temple and
found that the housekeeper had gone out for
the evening. They made as much fun as
they could over the difficulties of procuring
a meal, and avoided personal topics with a
scrupulous care, and did not once run the risk
of looking each other in the face. And
afterwards, when they had made themselves
comfortable in two chairs near the lamp and
conversation became inevitable, an awkward
embarrassment seized them both.</p>

<p>"It's very odd," said Katharine, frowning
a little; "but I have been bottling up things
to tell you for weeks, and now they seem to
have got congested in my brain and I can't get
one of them out. Why is it, I wonder? I
can't have grown suddenly shy of you; but
we seem to have lost touch, somehow. Oh,
it's queer; I don't like it!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span></p>

<p>She gave herself a little shake. Paul laughed
slightly.</p>

<p>"What an absurd child you are! It is only
because we have not been together lately, and
so we've lost the trick of it. You are always
turning yourself inside out, and then sitting
down a little way off to look at it."</p>

<p>"I believe I do," owned Katharine. "I
always want to know why certain things affect
me in certain ways."</p>

<p>"Did you want to know why you were
glad to see me, this evening?"</p>

<p>She looked up quickly at him for the first
time.</p>

<p>"No," she said, frankly. "At least, I don't
think I thought about it."</p>

<p>"Good child!" he said. "Don't think
about it." And she wondered why he looked
so pleased.</p>

<p>"Why not?" she asked him. "Please
tell me."</p>

<p>"Oh, because it isn't good for you to be
always turning yourself inside out; certainly
not on my account. Besides, it spoils things.
Don't you think so?"</p>

<p>"What things?"</p>

<p>"Oh, please! I'm not here to answer
such a lot of puzzling questions. Who has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
been getting you into such bad habits, while
I have been away?"</p>

<p>"Nobody who could answer any of my
puzzling questions," she replied, softly; and
Paul asked hastily if she would make the
coffee. He had fetched her here as an experiment,
a kind of test of his own feelings
and of hers; and he had a sudden fear lest
it should succeed too effectually. She went
obediently and did as she was told, and
brought him his coffee when it was ready;
and he submitted to having sugar in it, since
it compelled her to brush his hair with her
sleeve as she bent over him with the sugar
basin.</p>

<p>"Well?" he asked, in the next pause.
She was balancing her spoon on the edge of
her cup, with a curious smile on her face.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing!"</p>

<p>"Nothing must be very interesting, then.
But I don't suppose I have any right to know.
Have I?"</p>

<p>The spoon dropped on the floor with a
clatter.</p>

<p>"Of course you have! I wish you wouldn't
say those things! They hurt so. I was only
thinking,&mdash;it wasn't anything important,
but&mdash;I'm so awfully happy to-night."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span></p>

<p>"But that is surely of the very first importance.
Might one know why? Or is
that some one else's secret, too?"</p>

<p>She disturbed his composure by suddenly
pushing her coffee away from her; and there
was an angry light in her eyes, as she sprang
to her feet and stood looking down at him.</p>

<p>"Sometimes I think I hate you," she said;
and the words struck him as being strangely
inadequate to the occasion. They might
have been spoken by a petulant child, and
the moment before he had felt that she was
a woman. He put his cup down too, and
went towards her.</p>

<p>"Does sometimes mean now?" he asked
jestingly. He was trying, impotently, to prevent
her from going any farther. But she
took a step backward, and did not heed his
intention.</p>

<p>"Yes, it does," she said, angrily. "I am
tired of being treated like a child; I am tired
of letting you do what you like with me.
One day you spoil me; and another, you
hurt me cruelly. And you don't care a little
bit. I am a kind of amusement to you, an
interesting puzzle, a toy that doesn't seem to
break easily; that's all. And I just let you
do it,&mdash;it is my own fault; when you hurt me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
I hide what I feel, and when you are nice to
me I forget everything else. Oh, yes, of
course I am a fool; do you think I don't
know it? You have only to touch my face,
or to look at me, or to smile, and you know
I am in your hands. I despise myself for it;
I would give all I know to be strong enough
to put you out of my life. But I can't do it,
I can't! And you know I can't; you know
I am bound up in you. Everything I feel
seems to be yours; all my thoughts seem to
belong to you, directly they come into my
head; I can't take the smallest step without
wondering what you will think of it. Oh, I
hate myself for it; you don't know how I
hate myself! But I can't help it."</p>

<p>"Stop," said Paul, putting out his hand.
But she waved him away, and went on talking
rapidly.</p>

<p>"I must say it all now; it has been driving
me mad lately. At first, it seemed so
easy to get on without you; but it grew
much harder as it went on, and when you
stopped writing to me, I&mdash;I thought I should
go mad. It was so awful, too, when I had
got used to telling you things; there was no
one else I could tell things to, and the loneliness
of it was so terrible! I wanted to kill
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
myself, those days; but I was too big a
coward. So I got along somehow; and some
days it was easier than others, but it was
always hard. Only, nobody ever guessed.
Oh, if you knew how I have learnt to deceive
people! And there was always my work to
get through, as well; it has been horrible.
And I could no more help it than I could
help breathing. I wanted to kill myself!"</p>

<p>"Don't," half whispered Paul, and he came
a little nearer to her. But she turned and
leaned against the mantel-shelf for support, and
clasped the cold marble with her fingers.</p>

<p>"I must say it, Paul. If you like, I will go
away afterwards and never see you again. But
I cannot let it spoil my life any longer; I feel
as though you had got to hear it <i>now</i>. When
I wrote you that last letter, I said that if you
did not answer it I would not write to you
again, or think about you, or come and see
you any more. And you didn't answer it. I
got to loathe the postman's knock, because it
made my face hot, and I was afraid people
would find out. But they never did! I came
down to breakfast every day, in the hope of
finding a letter from you; and when there
wasn't one, and everything seemed a blank,&mdash;oh,
don't I know the awful look of that dining-room
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
when there isn't a letter from you!&mdash;I
just had to pretend that I hadn't expected to
find one at all." She paused expectantly, but
this time Paul made no attempt to speak. "I
was never any good at pretending, before," she
went on in a gentler tone, "but I believe I
could deceive any one now. Only, I never
succeeded in cheating myself! I used to find
out new ways to school, because the old ones
reminded me of you; and I had to do all my
crying in omnibuses, at the far end up by the
horses, because I dare not do it at Queen's
Crescent, where I might have been seen. For
I did cry sometimes." Her voice trembled,
and she ended with a little sob. She buried
her face in her hands.</p>

<p>"So that is what you have been doing for
these six weeks?" said Paul, involuntarily.</p>

<p>"Do you find it so amusing, then?" asked
Katharine in a stifled tone. He stepped up
behind her, and twisted her round gently by
the shoulders, so that she was obliged to look
at him. The hardness went from her face, and
she held out her hands to him instinctively.
"Paul," she said, piteously, "I couldn't help
it. Aren't you a little bit sorry for me?
What have I done that I should like the
wrong person? Other girls don't do these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
things. Am I awfully wicked, or awfully unlucky?
Paul, say something to me! Are you
very angry with me? But I couldn't help it,
I couldn't indeed! I have tried so hard to
make myself different, and I can't!"</p>

<p>He bit his lip and tried to say something,
but failed.</p>

<p>"And after all," she added in a low tone,
"when I had been schooling myself to hate
you for six weeks, I nearly went mad with joy
when Phyllis came and told me you were in
the hall. Oh, Paul, I know I am dreadfully
foolish! Will you ever respect me again, I
wonder?"</p>

<p>There was a quaint mixture of humour and
pathos in her tone; and he gathered her into
his arms and kissed her tenderly, without finding
any words with which to answer her. She
clung to him, and kissed him for the first time
in return, and forgot that she had once thought
it wrong to be caressed by him; just now, it
seemed the most natural thing in the world
that he should be comforting her for the suffering
of which he himself was the cause. And
her passionate wish to rouse him from his
apathy had ended in a weak desire to regain
his tolerance at any cost.</p>

<p>"You are not angry with me? I haven't
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
made you angry?" she asked him in an anxious
whisper.</p>

<p>"No, no, you foolish child!" was all he
said as he drew her closer.</p>

<p>"But it was dreadful of me to say all those
things to you, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"I like you to say dreadful things to me,
dear."</p>

<p>She swayed back from him at that, with her
two hands on his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Do you mean that, really? But&mdash;you
<i>must</i> think it dreadfully wicked of me to let
you kiss me, and to come and see you like
this? It is dreadfully wicked, isn't it? Oh, I
know it is; everybody would say so."</p>

<p>"I can't imagine what you mean. You are
a dear little Puritan to me. You don't know
what you are saying. Come, there are all those
things you have got to tell me. I want to hear
everything, please; whom you have been flirting
with, and all sorts of things. Now, it is no
use your pretending that you are going to hide
anything from me, because you know you
can't!"</p>

<p>He had resumed his former manner with
a rather conscious effort, and drew her down
beside him on the sofa. She tried to obey
him, but she could think of very little to say;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
and towards ten o'clock, Paul looked at his
watch.</p>

<p>"My child, you must go," he said. Katharine
rose to her feet with a sigh.</p>

<p>"I don't want to go," she said, reluctantly.</p>

<p>"Has it been nice, then?" he asked, smiling
at her dejected face.</p>

<p>"It has been the happiest evening I have
ever spent," she said, looking away from him.</p>

<p>"Surely not!" laughed Paul. "Think of
all the other evenings at the theatre, with Ted
and Monty and all the rest of them!"</p>

<p>"You know quite well," she said indignantly,
"that I like being with you better than with
any one else in the world. You know I do,
don't you?" she repeated, anxiously.</p>

<p>"It is enough for me that you say so,"
replied Paul; and they stood silent for a moment
or two. "Come, you really must go,
child," he said again. Katharine still remained
motionless, while he put on his coat.</p>

<p>"Must I?" she said, dreamily. He came
back to her and gave her a gentle shake.</p>

<p>"What is it, you strange little person? I
believe you would have been much happier if
I had not come back to bother you, eh?"</p>

<p>She denied it vehemently, and exerted herself
to talk to him all the way home in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
cab. She was solemn again, however, when
the time came to say good-bye.</p>

<p>"May I see you again soon?" she asked
him wistfully.</p>

<p>"Why, surely! We are going to have lots
of larks together, aren't we? Well, what is
it now?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I was only thinking!"</p>

<p>"What about?"</p>

<p>She unlocked the door with her latch-key
before she replied.</p>

<p>"It seems so odd," she said, "that I care
more about your opinion than about anybody
else's in the whole world; and yet I have given
you the most reason to think badly of me.
Isn't it awfully queer?"</p>

<p>She shut the door before he had time to
answer her. And Paul walked home, reflecting
on the futility of experiments.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p>The Sunday afternoon on which the Honourable
Mrs. Keeley gave her first reception, that
season, was a singularly dull and sultry one.
The room was filled with celebrities and their
satellites; and Katharine's head was aching
badly, as she struggled with difficulty through
the crowd and managed to squeeze herself into
a corner by the open window. She was always
affected by the weather; and to-day, she felt
unusually depressed by the absence of sunshine.
A voice from the balcony uttered her
name, and she turned round with a sigh, to
be met by the complacent features of Laurence
Heaton. For a moment she did not recognise
him; and then, the sound of his voice
carried her back to Ivingdon, and she smiled
back at him for the sake of the associations
he brought to her mind.</p>

<p>"Is it really two years?" he was saying.
"Seems impossible when I look at your face,
Miss Austen. Two years! And what have
you been doing with yourself all this time, eh?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
And how do you contrive to look so fresh on
a day like this? I am quite charmed to have
this opportunity of renewing so pleasant an
acquaintance."</p>

<p>He forgot that, when he had known her
before, she had annoyed him by not being
in his style. And Katharine answered him
vaguely, while her eyes wandered over the
crowd of faces; for Paul had told her he was
going to be there, and she felt restless.</p>

<p>"Small place the world is, to be sure," continued
Heaton, with the air of a man who
says something that has not been said before.
"Who would have expected you to turn up
at my old friends', the Keeleys'? Most curious
coincidence, I must say!" Katharine,
who knew of his very recent introduction
to the house, explained her own relationship
demurely. But her companion was quite unabashed,
and changed the conversation skilfully.</p>

<p>"Wilton often comes here, he tells me.
You remember Wilton, don't you? Ah, of
course you do, since it is to him that I owe
your charming acquaintance," he said, gallantly.
"He met them at Nice, or somewhere.
Astonishing how many people one
meets at Nice! Wilton always meets every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
one, though, and every one likes him; he's
so brilliant, don't you think? Yes, brilliant
exactly describes him. Ever seen him since
he stayed in your delightful rural home?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I see him here sometimes. And my
aunt is expecting him to-day, I believe."</p>

<p>"I have no doubt of it, no doubt of it
whatever!" smiled Heaton, nodding his head
wisely. "If I'm not very much mistaken,
Wilton is often the guest of Mrs. Keeley,
is he not?"</p>

<p>The meaning in his remarks was wasted on
Katharine, for most of her attention was still
concentrated on the doorway. But Heaton,
to whom she was more of an excuse than a
reason for conversation, rambled on contentedly.</p>

<p>"Nice fellow, Wilton, to bring me here,
pretending he wanted me to know her! Not
much chance of that, I fancy! I haven't had
two words with her since I first called here
with him, three weeks ago. Ah, well, I
mustn't be surprised at that,&mdash;an old fellow
like me; though I would have you know,
Miss Austen, that I am still young enough to
admire the charms of a beautiful woman!
But it is amusing, all the same, to watch how a
serious fellow like Wilton suddenly forgets all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
his prejudices against marriage, and behaves
like every one else. If it had been me, now&mdash;but
then, I'm a marrying man, and I've
had two of the sweetest wives God ever gave
to erring man&mdash;&nbsp;Ah, I beg your pardon?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't quite understand," said Katharine.</p>

<p>"Nobody does, my dear young lady;
nobody does. It is impossible to understand
a clever, quiet sort of chap like Wilton. To
begin with, he doesn't mean you to. But
I'm heartily glad he has made such a fortunate
choice; he is an old friend of mine, and
my friends' happiness is always my happiness.
He is lucky, for all that; beauty and money
and influence, all combined in one charming
person, are not to be despised, are they? She
is so sweet, too; and sweetness in a woman is
worth all the virtues put together, don't you
agree with me? Now, tell me,&mdash;woman's
opinion is always worth having,&mdash;do you
consider her so very pretty?"</p>

<p>"I don't know whom you mean," said
Katharine. She was wishing he would take
his idle chatter away to some one else. But
Heaton was accustomed to inattention on the
part of his hearers, and he was not disconcerted
by hers.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, the beautiful Miss Keeley, to be
sure," he replied. "For all that," he added,
hastily, "I think she is rather overrated, don't
you?" This was meant to be very cunning,
for he prided himself on being an accomplished
lady's man. But Katharine's reply baffled
him.</p>

<p>"Do you mean Marion? I think she
is beautiful," she said, warmly. "I am
not surprised that every one should admire
her."</p>

<p>"Just so, just so; quite my view of the
case!" exclaimed Heaton, at once. "I call
her unique, don't you? 'Pon my word, I
never felt more pleased at anything in my
life! What a future for Wilton, with the
Honourable Mrs. Keeley for a mother-in-law,
and her beautiful daughter for a wife; why,
we shall see him in Parliament before long!
The Attorney-General of the future,&mdash;there's
no doubt about it. Ah, I see you are smiling
at my enthusiasm, Miss Austen. That
is because you do not know me well enough
to realise how much my friends are to me.
All the real happiness in my life comes from
my friends, it does indeed. But I am boring
you with this dull conversation about myself.
Come along with me, and I'll see where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
the ices are to be found. Young people always
like ices, eh?"</p>

<p>And she yielded to his kindly good-nature,
even while she felt indignant with him for
spreading such an absurd piece of gossip.
And what had Paul been doing, to allow such
an idea to take root in his foolish old head?
He had known nothing of the rumour on
Wednesday, for she had been to a concert
with him then, and he had never once alluded
to her cousin. Of course, it was ridiculous to
give it another thought, and she roused herself
to chatter gaily to her companion as they
slowly made their way downstairs.</p>

<p>But, as she stood in the crowded dining-room,
wedged between the table and Heaton
who was occupied for the moment in seeking
for champagne cup, she became again the unwilling
hearer of that same absurd piece of gossip.
It sounded less blatant, perhaps, from the
lips of the two magnificent dowagers who were
lightly discussing it, but it was hardly less vulgar
in its essence; and Katharine ceased to be
gay, and shrank instinctively away from them.</p>

<p>"Who is he? I seem to know the name,
but I never remember meeting him anywhere.
Surely her mother would not throw her away
on a nobody? She expects such great things
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
from Marion, one is always led to believe;
though she is just the sort of girl to end in
being a disappointment, don't you think so?"</p>

<p>"My dear, it is a <i>fait accompli</i>, and he is not
a nobody at all. He would not visit here if he
were; at least, not seriously. His name is
Wilton,&mdash;something Wilton, Peter or Paul or
one of the apostles, I forget which. He belongs
to a very good Yorkshire family, I am
told. His father was a bishop, or it may have
been a canon; at all events, he was not an
ordinary person. Mr. Wilton, this one, is one
of our rising men, I believe,&mdash;a lawyer, or a
barrister, or something of that sort. He defended
the plaintiff in the Christopher case,
don't you remember? And with Mrs. Keeley
to back him up, he will soon be in the front
rank,&mdash;there is no doubt about that. They
always ice the coffee too much here, don't
they? Have you seen Marion to-day?"</p>

<p>"Yes. She's over there in the same green
silk. Wonderful hair, isn't it? A little too
red for my taste, but any one can see it is wonderful.
He's over there too, but you can't
see him from here. He is much older than
Marion, and delicate looking. I shouldn't
like a child of mine to marry him, but that's
another matter. And, of course, all <i>my</i> girls
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
were so particular about looks. How insufferably
hot it is! Shall we go upstairs?"</p>

<p>Laurence Heaton had a second glass of
champagne cup, and when he had drunk it he
found that Katharine was gone. He dismissed
her from his mind without any difficulty, however,
and fought his way upstairs to find some
one who was more to his taste. He certainly
did not connect her disappearance with his gossip,
nor yet with his old friend, Paul Wilton.</p>

<p>And Katharine could not have told him herself
why she had slipped away so abruptly.
Of course, the rumour was not true; she did
not believe a word of it; and it was disloyal to
Paul even to be annoyed by it. But it was
disquieting, all the same, to hear his name so
persistently coupled with her cousin's; and she
wondered if her aunt knew any of his views
against marriage, to which she had been so
often a humble listener. And it was equally
certain that he was one of the most rising men
of the day; she did not want to be told that
by a number of society gossips, who had never
even heard of him until he paid his attentions
to one of their set,&mdash;just the ordinary attentions
of a courteous man to a beautiful woman.
Had he not repeatedly told her that she knew
more about his real life and his real self, more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
about his ambition and his work, than any one
else in the world? He had chosen her out of all
his friends for a confidant; and yet, she might
not even acknowledge her friendship for him.
He only trifled with Marion, teased her about
the number of her admirers, talked to her
about the colour of her hair, and the daintiness
of her appearance; he had told her that, too.
Marion knew nothing of his aspirations; she
would not understand them, if she did. And
yet it was common talk that he admired
Marion, while <i>she</i> was to make a secret of her
intimacy with him. Something of the old feeling
of rebellion against him, which had been
dead ever since the evening they had supped
together in his chambers, was in her mind as
she left the house where he was sitting with
Marion, and walked aimlessly towards the
park. The sun had completely vanished in a
dull red mist; and the intense heat and lurid
atmosphere did not tend to raise her spirits.
A nameless feeling of impending trouble crept
over her, and she felt powerless to shake it off.
She wandered along the edge of the crowds
as they listened to the labour agitators, past
groups of children playing on the grass, past
endless pairs of lovers in their Sunday garments,
until the noisy tramp of footsteps began
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
to grate upon her nerves; and she turned and
fled from the park, as she had fled from Curzon
Street. Something at last took her towards the
Temple, and an hour later she was knocking
furtively at the door of Paul's chambers. She
had never been there on a Sunday before, and
the deserted look of the courts, and the silk
dress of the housekeeper whom she met on the
stairs, depressed her still further. Would she
come in and wait, the housekeeper suggested,
as Mr. Wilton was out, and had not said when
he would be back? But Katharine shook her
head wearily, and turned her face homewards.
Even the solitude of Queen's Crescent could
not be worse than the unfriendliness of the
deserted London streets. She went out of her
way to walk down Curzon Street, without
knowing why she did so, and took the trouble
to cross over to the side opposite her aunt's
house, also without a definite purpose in her
mind. It was not much after eight, but the
storm was still gathering, and there was only
just enough daylight left to show the figure of
a girl on the balcony. It was Marion, beyond
any doubt Marion, who was leaning forward
and looking down into the street as though
she expected to see some one come out of the
house. The front door opened, and a man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
came down the steps; he looked up and raised
his hat, and lingered; and Marion glanced
hastily around, kissed her fingers to him, and
vanished indoors. The man walked away
down the street with a leisurely step, and
Katharine stepped back into the shadow of
the portico. But her caution was quite unnecessary,
for neither of them had noticed
her.</p>

<p>For the second time that evening Katharine
knocked gently at the door of Paul's chambers
in the Temple. This time, he opened to her
himself.</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" he was startled into exclaiming.
"What in the name of wonder has
brought you here at this time of night? It is
to be hoped you didn't meet any one on the
stairs, did you?"</p>

<p>He motioned her in as he spoke, and shut
the door. Katharine walked past him in a
half-dazed kind of way. There had been only
two feelings expressed in his face, and one was
surprise, and the other annoyance.</p>

<p>"What is it, Katharine? Has anything
gone wrong?" he demanded in his low, masterful
tone. Katharine turned cold; she had
never realised before how pitilessly masterful
his tone was.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span></p>

<p>"I couldn't help coming,&mdash;I was so miserable!
They were all saying things about
you, things that were not true. And I wanted
to hear you say they were not true. I couldn't
rest; so I came. Are you angry with me for
coming, Paul?"</p>

<p>She faltered out the words, without looking
at him. Paul shrugged his shoulders, but
she did not see the movement.</p>

<p>"It was hardly worth while, was it,
to risk your reputation merely to confirm
what you had already settled in your own
mind?"</p>

<p>She opened her eyes, and stared at him
hopelessly. Paul walked away to look for
some cigarette papers in the pocket of a coat.</p>

<p>"Was it?" he repeated, with his back
turned to her. Katharine struggled to answer
him.</p>

<p>"You have never spoken to me like that,
before," she stammered at last.</p>

<p>"You have never given me any cause, have
you?" said Paul, rather awkwardly.</p>

<p>"But what have I done?" she asked, taking
a step towards him. "I didn't know you
would mind. I always come to you when I
am unhappy; you told me I might. And I
was unhappy this evening; so I came. Why
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
should it be different this evening? I don't
understand what you mean. Why are you
angry with me? You have never been angry
before. What have I done?"</p>

<p>"My dear child, there is no occasion for
heroics," said Paul, speaking very gently.
"I am not angry with you at all. But you
must own that it is at least unusual to call
upon a man, uninvited, at this unearthly hour.
And hadn't you better sit down, now you
have come?"</p>

<p>Katharine did not move.</p>

<p>"What does it matter if it is unusual?"
she asked. "You know I have been here
sometimes, as late as this, before. There is
no harm in it, is there? Paul! tell me what
I have done to annoy you?"</p>

<p>Paul gave up rummaging in his coat pocket,
and came and sat on the edge of the table,
and made a cigarette.</p>

<p>"I seem to remember having this same
argument with you before," he observed.
"Don't you think it is rather futile to go
all through it again? You know quite well
that it is entirely for your sake that I wish
to be careful. Hadn't we better change the
subject? If you are going to stop, you might
be more comfortable in a chair."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span></p>

<p>Katharine clenched her hands in the effort
to keep back her tears.</p>

<p>"I am not going to stay," she cried, miserably.
"I can't understand why you are so
cruel to me; I think it must amuse you to
hurt me. Why do you ask me to come and
see you sometimes, quite as late as this, and
then object to my coming to-night? I don't
know what you mean."</p>

<p>Paul lighted his cigarette before he answered
her.</p>

<p>"You have quite a talent, Katharine, for
asking uncomfortable questions. If you cannot
see the difference between coming when
you are asked, and coming uninvited, I am
afraid I cannot help you. Would you like
any coffee or anything?"</p>

<p>All at once her brain began to clear. For
two hours she had been wandering aimlessly
through the streets, in a strange bewilderment
of mind, not knowing why she was there nor
where she was going. Then she had found
herself in Fleet Street; and habit, rather than
intention, had brought her to the Temple.
And now his maddening indifference had
touched her pride, and her deadened faculties
began slowly to revive under the shock. She
put her fingers over her eyes, and tried to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
think. The blood rushed to her face, and
she thrilled all over with a passionate instinct
of resistance. He did not know what to
make of her, when she stepped suddenly in
front of him and faced him unflinchingly.</p>

<p>"You must not expect me to see the difference,"
she said, proudly. "I shall never
understand why I have to make a secret of
what is not wrong, nor why you allow me to
do it at all if it is wrong. I think you have
been playing with my friendship all the time;
I can see now that you have not valued it,
because I gave it you so freely. But I didn't
know that; I wasn't clever enough; and I
had never liked anybody but you. I didn't
know that I ought to hide it, and pretend that
I didn't like you. Perhaps, if I had done
that you would have gone on liking me."</p>

<p>He was going to interrupt her, but she did
not give him time.</p>

<p>"Would you ask Marion Keeley to come
and see you, as you have asked me?"</p>

<p>Paul's face grew dark, and she trembled
suddenly at her own boldness.</p>

<p>"I fail to see how such a question can interest
either of us," he said, coldly.</p>

<p>"But would you ask her?" she repeated.</p>

<p>"I am perfectly assured," he replied, quietly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
"that if I were to forget myself so far as to do
so, Miss Keeley would certainly not come."</p>

<p>"Then you mean to say that it has always
been dreadfully wrong of <i>me</i> to come?"</p>

<p>"Really, Katharine, you are very quarrelsome
this evening," said Paul, with a forced
laugh. "I have repeatedly pointed out to
you that a man chooses some of his friends
for pleasure, and others for business. I really
fail to see why I should be subjected to this
minute catechism at your hands."</p>

<p>"Then you chose Marion&mdash;for business?
It is true, then, what they said! I wish&mdash;oh, I
wish you had never chosen me&mdash;for pleasure!"</p>

<p>The anger had died out of her voice; he
could hardly hear what she said; but he made
a last attempt to treat the matter lightly.</p>

<p>"I really think, my child, that any comparison
between you and your cousin is unnecessary,"
he began in a conciliating manner.</p>

<p>"I thought so too, until to-day," she replied,
piteously.</p>

<p>"But what has happened to-day to put
you in this uncomfortable frame of mind?"</p>

<p>"It is what every one is saying about you
and Marion,&mdash;all those horrid people, and Mr.
Heaton, and everybody. I want to know if
it is true. Everything is going wrong, everywhere.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
I wish I were dead! I came to ask
you if it is true; I thought I might do that;
I thought I knew you well enough. I didn't
know you would mind. If you like, I will
go away now, and never come and see you
any more, or bother you, or let you know
that I care for you so awfully. Only, tell
me first, Paul, whether it is true or not?"</p>

<p>Her voice had risen, as she went on, and
it ended full of passionate entreaty. The
stern look on his face deepened, but he did
not speak.</p>

<p>"I wish I knew the meaning of it all," she
continued, relentlessly as it seemed to him. "I
wish it were easier to like the right people,
and to hate all the others. Why was I made
the wrong way? If I had never wanted to like
you, it would have been so simple. It would
not have mattered, then, that you did not
really care for me. But I wish I understood
you better. Why did you tell me that you
wanted me for your friend, always; and that
you didn't believe in marriage, and those
things? I believed you so, Paul; and I was
content to be your friend; you know I was,
don't you? And now you have met Marion,
and she is beautiful, and she can help you to
get on, to become one of the first men in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
country, they said. And you have forgotten
all about your views against marriage; and
you allow people to talk as though you were
making a kind of bargain. Oh, it is horrible!
But it isn't true, Paul, is it?"</p>

<p>"Who has been telling you all these
things?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Then it is true? You are going to marry
her, because of the position, and all that? I
wish it wasn't so difficult to understand. Is
it a crime, I wonder, to like any one so desperately
as I like you? But I can't help it,
can I? Oh, Paul, do tell me what to do?"</p>

<p>He winced as she turned to him so naturally
for protection, even though it was against
himself that she asked it.</p>

<p>"Don't talk like that, child," he said,
harshly. And the hand she had held out to
him appealingly fell down limply at her side.</p>

<p>"I can't expect you to think anything of
me, after what I have just said to you," she
went on in the same hopeless voice. "Girls
are never supposed to tell those things, are
they? It doesn't seem to me to matter much,
now that it has all got to stop, for always.
I only wish&mdash;I wish it had stopped before.
I&mdash;I am going now, Paul."</p>

<p>Although she turned away from him, she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
still half expected him to come and comfort
her. For a couple of seconds she stood quite
still, possessed with a terrible longing to be
comforted by him. But he sat motionless and
silent on the table; even his foot had ceased
swinging. She walked unsteadily to the door.</p>

<p>"Stop," said Paul. "You cannot go out in
this storm."</p>

<p>A peal of thunder broke over the house as
he spoke. She had not noticed the rain until
then.</p>

<p>"I must go," she said dully, and fumbled at
the fastening of the door. Paul came and took
her by the arm, and led her back gently.</p>

<p>"I want to explain, first," he said.</p>

<p>"There is nothing to explain," said Katharine.
"I understand."</p>

<p>"Not quite, I think," said Paul. They were
standing together by the table, and he was
nervously caressing the hand he held between
his own. "You have only been talking from
your own point of view; you have forgotten
mine altogether. You do not seem to think
that I, too, may have had something to suffer."</p>

<p>"You? But you do not care&mdash;as I do."</p>

<p>He did not heed the interruption.</p>

<p>"It is the system that is at fault," he said.
"A man has to get on at the sacrifice of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
happiness; or he has to be happy at the
sacrifice of his position. It is difficult for
a woman to realise this. She never has to
choose between love and ambition."</p>

<p>"And you have chosen&mdash;ambition," said
Katharine bitterly.</p>

<p>"My child, when you are older you will
understand that the very qualities you affect to
despise in man now, are the qualities that endear
him to you in reality. You are far too
fine a woman, Katharine, to love a man who
has no ambition. Is it not so?"</p>

<p>She quivered, and lowered her eyes.</p>

<p>"I don't know," she said. "It seems so
hard."</p>

<p>"It is terribly hard for both of us," continued
Paul, looking down too. "But believe
me, there would be nothing but unhappiness before
us if it were otherwise. I am thinking
of you, child, as much as of myself. Marriage
for love alone is a ghastly mistake. There, I
have said more to you than I have ever said
to any woman; I felt you would understand,
Katharine."</p>

<p>He mistook her silence for indifference, and
put his arms round her. But she clung to him
closely, and lifted her face to his and broke out
into a desperate appeal.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span></p>

<p>"Paul, don't say those horrid, bitter things!
They are not true; I will never believe they are
true. Why must you marry for anything so
sordid as ambition? Why must you marry at
all? Can't we go on being friends? I want
to go on being your friend. Paul, don't send
me away for ever. I can't go, Paul; I can't! I
will work for you, I will be your slave, I will
do anything; only don't let it all stop like
this. I can't bear it; I can't! Won't you go
on being nice to me, Paul?"</p>

<p>He threw back his head and compressed his
lips. He had grown quite white in the last few
moments. She sobbed out her entreaties with
her face hidden on his shoulder, and wondered
why he did not speak to her.</p>

<p>"Why did you never look like that before?"
he asked in a hoarse whisper. She
raised her head and stared at him with large,
frightened eyes.</p>

<p>"Like what, Paul? What do you mean?"</p>

<p>He flung her away from him almost roughly.</p>

<p>"You must go," he said, "at once."</p>

<p>She laid her hand on his arm, and looked
into his face.</p>

<p>"Why are you so angry?" she asked, wonderingly.
"Is it because I have told you all
these things?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span></p>

<p>"My God, no! You must go," he repeated,
vehemently, and pushed her towards the door.
She stumbled as she went, and he thought he
heard her sob. He sprang to her side instantly,
and took her in his arms again.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you go quickly?" he gasped,
as he crushed her against him.</p>

<p>His sudden change of manner terrified her.
None of the tenderness or the indifference, or
any of the expressions she was accustomed to
see on his face were there now, and his violence
repelled her. She struggled to free herself
from his grasp.</p>

<p>"Let me go, Paul!" she pleaded. "I don't
want to stop any more. What is the good of
it all? You know I have got to go; don't
make it so difficult. Paul, I&mdash;I <i>want</i> to go."</p>

<p>He looked searchingly into her eyes, as
though he would have read her inmost
thoughts; but he did not see the understanding
he had almost hoped to find there, and
he laughed shortly and relinquished his hold
of her.</p>

<p>"There, go!" he said in an uncertain tone.
"Why did I expect you to know? Your day
hasn't come yet. Meanwhile&mdash;&nbsp;Ah! what
am I saying?"</p>

<p>"I have annoyed you again," said Katharine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
sorrowfully. "What ought I to have
known?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing," said Paul, flinging open the
door. "You can't help it. Now and again
Nature makes woman a prig, and it is only the
right man who can regenerate her. Unfortunately,
circumstances prevent me from being
the right man. Are you ready to come, now?"</p>

<p>He spoke rapidly, hardly knowing what he
said. But Katharine walked past him without
speaking, with a set look on her face. He
talked mechanically about the storm and anything
else that occurred to him, as they went
downstairs, but she did not utter a word, and
he did not seem to notice her silence. She held
out her hand to him as they stood in the doorway.</p>

<p>"You will let me see you to a cab?" he said.
"Oh, very well, as you like; but, at least, take
an umbrella with you."</p>

<p>She shook her head mutely, and plunged
out into the rain and the storm. It was on
just such a night as this, more than two years
ago, that she had first gone out to meet him.
Paul called after her to come back and take
shelter; and some one, who was walking
swiftly by, turned round at the sound of his
voice. The dim lamp above shed its uncertain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
light for a moment on the faces of the
three, whom circumstances had thus strangely
brought together in the fury of that June
thunder-storm. It was only for a moment. Paul
drew back again into the doorway, and Katharine
stumbled blindly against the man outside.</p>

<p>"Ted!" she cried, with a sob of relief.
"Take me home, Ted, will you? Something
terrible has happened to me; I can't tell you
now. Oh, I am so glad it is you!"</p>

<p>She clung to his arm convulsively. Some
clock in the neighbourhood was striking the
hour, and it struck twelve times before Ted
spoke.</p>

<p>"Kitty!" he said.</p>

<p>She waited, but not another word came.
Exhaustion prevented her from resisting, as
he led her to a hansom, and paid the driver,
and left her. Then she remembered dimly
that he had not spoken to her, except for that
one startled exclamation.</p>

<p>It seemed to Katharine as though nothing
could be wanting to complete her wretchedness.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p>But, humiliated as she was, the predominant
feeling in her mind was astonishment. Could
it be true that she was a prig? Was that the
final definition of the pride and the strength
in which she had gloried until now? Was
that all that people meant when they told
her she was not like other girls? It was an
odious revelation, and for the moment her self-respect
was stunned by it. She had boasted
of her success; and to be successful was merely
to be priggish. She had been proud of her
virtue; and virtue, again, was only an equivalent
for priggishness. She wondered vaguely
whether there was a single aspiration left that
did not lead to the paths of priggishness. A
prig! He had called her a prig! She had
thought it such a fine thing to be content with
his friendship, and this was the end of it all.
All the wretchedness of her solitary drive
home was centred in those last cruel words of
his; all the bitterness of that long, miserable
Sunday was concentrated in that covert insult.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
She could have borne his indifference, or even
his displeasure; but she could have killed him
for his contempt.</p>

<p>And Ted? She did not give a thought to
Ted. Even the reason for his curious behaviour
had not fully dawned upon her yet.
It had only seemed in keeping with the rest
of her misfortunes, just like the rain, which
she allowed to beat in upon her, with a kind
of reckless satisfaction. In the fulness of her
more absorbing personal trouble, Ted would
have to wait. It had been her experience
that Ted always could wait. It was not until
she stood once more within the familiar hall
of number ten, Queen's Crescent, that the
recollection of Ted's astonished look returned
to her mind; and then she put it hastily away
from her, as something that would have to be
faced presently.</p>

<p>As she walked into her room, too weary to
think any more, and longing for the temporary
oblivion of a night's rest, the first thing
that met her eye was the unmade condition
of her bed. The desolate look of the tiny
compartment was the crowning point of her
day of woe; and the tears, which she had kept
back until now, rushed to her eyes. It seemed
a little hard that, on this day of all others,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
Phyllis should have neglected to make her
bed. She gave it an impatient push, and it
scraped loudly over the bare boards.</p>

<p>"Stop that row!" said Polly's sharp voice
from the other end of the room. "You might
be quiet, now you <i>have</i> come in."</p>

<p>"Is Phyllis asleep?" asked Katharine shortly.</p>

<p>"Can't you be quiet?" growled Polly.
"Haven't you heard she is worse? Don't
see how you should, though,&mdash;coming in at
this hour of the night!"</p>

<p>"Worse?" With an effort, Katharine's
thoughts travelled back over the absorbing
events of the day, to the early morning; and
she remembered that Phyllis had stayed in
bed with a headache. "What is the matter
with her?" she asked, faintly. Everything
seemed to be conspiring against her happiness
to-day.</p>

<p>"Influenza. A lot you care! Nothing
but my cousin's funeral would have taken me
out to-day, I know. I had to show up for
that. Of course, I thought you would look
after her; I asked you to."</p>

<p>Katharine had pushed aside the curtain, and
was looking at the flushed, unconscious face of
her friend. She dimly remembered saying
she would stop with her; and then a letter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
had come from Paul, asking her to meet him
in the park, and she had thought no more
of Phyllis. She had not even succeeded in
meeting him; and again her eyes filled with
tears at her own misfortunes.</p>

<p>"I couldn't help it," she said, miserably.
"How was I to know she was so bad? Have
you taken her temperature?"</p>

<p>"Hundred and three, when I last took it.
It's no use standing there and pulling a long
face. She doesn't know you; so it's rather
late in the day to be cut up. You'd better
go to bed, I should say; you look as though
you'd been out all day, and half the night,
too!"</p>

<p>She ended with a contemptuous sniff. Katharine
rubbed the tears out of her eyes. The
weariness had temporarily left her.</p>

<p>"Let me sit up with her," she said.</p>

<p>"You? What could you do? Why,
you'd fall asleep, or think of something else
in the middle, and she might die for all you
cared," returned Polly contemptuously. "Can
you make a poultice?"</p>

<p>Katharine shook her head dumbly, and
crept away. Her self-abasement seemed complete.
She lay down on her untidy bed, and
drew the clothes over her, and gave way to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
her grief. There did not seem a bright spot
in her existence, now that Phyllis was not able
to comfort her. She hoped, with a desperate
fervour, that she would catch influenza too,
and die, so that remorse should consume the
hearts of all those who had so cruelly misunderstood
her.</p>

<p>A hand shook her by the shoulder, not
unkindly.</p>

<p>"Look here! you must stop that row, or else
you will disturb her. What's the good of it?
Besides, she isn't as bad as all that either; you
can't have seen much illness, I'm thinking."</p>

<p>"It isn't that," gasped Katharine truthfully.
"At least, not entirely. I was dreadfully
unhappy about something else, and I
wanted to die; and then, when I found Phyllis
was ill, it all seemed so hopeless. I didn't
mean to disturb any one; it was dreadfully
foolish of me; I haven't cried for years."</p>

<p>Polly gave a kind of grunt, and sat down
on the bed. It was more or less interesting
to have reduced the brilliant Miss Austen to
this state of submission.</p>

<p>"Got yourself into trouble?" she asked,
and refrained from adding that she had expected
it all along.</p>

<p>Katharine began to cry again. There was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
so little sympathy, and so much curiosity, in
the curt question. But she had reached the
point when to confide in some one was an absolute
necessity; and there was no one else.</p>

<p>"I haven't done anything wrong," she
sobbed. "Why should one suffer so awfully,
just because one didn't <i>know</i>! We were
only friends, and it was so pleasant, and I
was so happy! It might have gone on for
ever, only there was another girl."</p>

<p>"Of course," said Polly. "There always
is. How did she get hold of him?"</p>

<p>Katharine shrank back into herself.</p>

<p>"You don't understand," she complained.
"He isn't like that at all. He is clever, and
refined, and very reserved. He doesn't flirt
a bit, or anything of that sort."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see," said Polly, with her expressive
sniff. "I suppose the other girl thought
herself a toff, eh?"</p>

<p>"She is the most beautiful girl I have ever
seen," said Katharine simply. "But I never
knew he cared about that. He had views
against marriage, he always said; and he wasn't
always talking about women, like some men.
I did not think he would end in marrying,
just like every one else."</p>

<p>"More innocent you, then! I always said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
you ought to have stopped at home; girls
like you generally do come the worst cropper.
You surely didn't suppose he would go on
for ever, and be content merely with your
friendship, did you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I did," said Katharine wearily. "Why
not? I was content with his."</p>

<p>Polly gave vent to a stifled laugh.</p>

<p>"My dear, you're not a man," she said in a
superior tone. It added considerably to the
piquancy of the conversation that the subject
was one on which she was a greater authority
than her clever companion.</p>

<p>"But he really cared for me, I am certain he
did," Katharine went on plaintively; and her
eyes filled with tears again.</p>

<p>"Then why is he marrying the other girl
instead of you? If she is so beautiful, you're
surely very good-looking too, eh? That won't
wash anyhow, will it?"</p>

<p>Katharine was silent. She felt she could
not reveal the full extent of his infamy just
then; there was something so particularly sordid
in having been weighed against the advantages
of a worldly marriage and found wanting;
and she felt a sudden disinclination to expose
the whole of the truth to the sharp criticism
of Polly Newland.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span></p>

<p>"I haven't done anything wrong," she said
again. "I don't understand why things are so
unfairly arranged. Why should I suffer for it
like this?"</p>

<p>"Don't know about that," retorted the uncompromising
Polly. "I expect you've been
foolish, and that's a worse game than being
bad. Going about town with a man after dark,
when you're not engaged to him, isn't considered
respectable by most, even if it's always
the same man. I'm not so particular as some,
but you must draw the line somewhere."</p>

<p>"I didn't go about with him much," said
Katharine, making a feeble attempt to justify
herself. "He didn't care about it; he was
always so particular not to give people anything
to talk about. He didn't care for himself,
he said; it was only for me. So I used
to go to his chambers instead. I couldn't
be more careful than that, could I? And I
should have gone in the daytime, if I had had
more time; but there was all my work to get
through,&mdash;so what else could I do? There
wasn't any harm in it."</p>

<p>She could not see her companion's face, and
was so full of her own reflections that she
failed to notice her silence. Polly did not even
sniff.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span></p>

<p>"Then there's Ted," Katharine continued
presently. "Even Ted was strange to-night;
and Ted has never been like that to me before.
I can't think what has come over everybody.
What have I done to deserve it all?"</p>

<p>"Mercy me!" cried Polly suddenly. "Is
there another of them? Who on earth is
Ted?"</p>

<p>"Ted? Why, you must have seen him in
the hall sometimes; he often comes to take me
out. I have known him all my life; he is only
a little older than I am, and I am devoted to
him. I would not quarrel with Ted for anything
in the whole world; it would be like
quarrelling with myself. And to-night I ran
into him, just as I came out of&mdash;of the other
one's chambers; and I was so glad to see him,
because Ted is always so sweet to me when I
am in trouble; and&mdash;and Ted was quite funny,
and he wouldn't speak to me at all, and he just
put me into a hansom and left me to come
home alone. I can't think why he behaved so
oddly. I know he used not to get on with&mdash;with
the other one, and that is why I never
told him I had met him again up here in London;
and I suppose he caught sight of him to-night
in the doorway,&mdash;there was a lamp just
above,&mdash;but still, he need not have been hurt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
until he had heard my explanation, need he?
Why has every one turned against me at
once?"</p>

<p>Polly remained silent no longer. She turned
and stared at the prostrate figure on the bed,
with all the power of her small, watery blue
eyes.</p>

<p>"I really think you beat everything I ever
knew," she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"What?" said Katharine, who had turned
her face to the wall, and was occupied in meditating
miserably on the problem of her existence.
"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>Polly lost all control over herself.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to tell me that you never
saw any harm in all this?" she cried emphatically.
"Do you really mean to say that you
have been carrying on anyhow with two men at
once, going to their chambers late at night, and
letting yourself be seen in public with them,
without knowing that it was unusual? Didn't
you ever see the danger in it? You are either
the biggest fool in creation or the biggest
humbug! One man at a time would be bad
enough; but two! My eye!"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;there wasn't any harm," pleaded
Katharine. "Why does no one understand?
It seemed quite natural to me. They were so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
different, and I liked them in such opposite
ways, don't you see? I have known Ted all
my life; he is a dear boy, and that is all. But
Paul is clever and strong; he is a man, and
he knows about things. And I never knew
it was wrong; I didn't <i>feel</i> wicked, somehow.
I wonder if that was what Paul was thinking,
when he said I was a prig? Oh, dear! oh,
dear! I have never been so wretched in my
whole life!"</p>

<p>"Did he say that about you? Well, I
don't wonder."</p>

<p>Katharine looked hopelessly at her unsympathetic
profile, with the snub nose and the
small chin, and the hair twisted up into tight
plaits and the ends tied with white tape; and
her eyes wandered down the red flannel dressing-gown
to the large slippered feet that
emerged from beneath it.</p>

<p>"You called me a prig, too," she said, humbly.
"I overheard you."</p>

<p>"I thought so then," said Polly gruffly.</p>

<p>"Do you think so now? Is it true? Am
I a prig?" She awaited the answer anxiously.
Polly gave her another pitiless stare.</p>

<p>"I'm bothered if I know," she said. "But
if you're not, you ought to be in the nursery.
Only don't go telling people the things you've
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
been telling me to-night, or you might get
yourself into worse trouble. You'd better go
to sleep now, and leave it till to-morrow. My
conscience! you'd make some people sit up,
you would!"</p>

<p>Katharine felt she had endured as much contempt
as she could bear that evening; but
she made a last attempt to recover some of her
self-respect.</p>

<p>"I wish you would tell me why it is wrong
to do things that are not really wrong in
themselves, just because people say they are
wrong?" she asked, rather sleepily.</p>

<p>"Because people can make it so jolly unpleasant
for you if you don't agree with them,"
said Polly bluntly. "And if you fancy you're
going to alter all that, you must make up your
mind to be called a prig. You can't have a
good time and defy convention as you've
been doing, and then expect to get off scot free
without being called a prig; it isn't likely.
Most people are content to take things as they
are; it's a jolly sight more comfortable, and it's
good enough for them. Good-night."</p>

<p>"I sha'n't sleep," Katharine called after her.
And Polly sniffed.</p>

<p>And the next thing that Katharine remembered
was being awakened by her in the early
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
morning, and told in a gruff voice that she
might sit with Phyllis if she liked, until some
one came to relieve her.</p>

<p>"All right," she replied, drowsily. "How
tired you look; didn't you sleep well?"</p>

<p>"Sleep? There wasn't much chance of
that, when she was talking gibberish all the
time. She's quieter now, and you can fetch
Jenny if you want anything. I must be off; I
shall be late as it is. Just like my luck to get
my early week when she is ill!"</p>

<p>And there by the bedside of Phyllis Hyam,
before any one else in the house was astir,
Katharine sat and pondered again over the
events of the day before. They seemed just
as tragic as ever, separated as they were from
her by a few hours of forgetfulness; and she
wondered miserably how she was going to take
up her life as usual, and go about her work as
though nothing had happened. "That is why
it is so hard to be a woman," she murmured,
full of pity for her own troubles. And yet,
when Miss Jennings came and took her post
in the sick-room, and she was free to go to
school, she found that it was a relief to be
compelled to do something, and her work
seemed easier to her than she had ever found
it before. She had never given a better lecture
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
than she gave that morning; and something
that was outside herself seemed to come to her
assistance all day, and remained with her until
her work was done. But when she returned
home in the evening, the full significance of
her unfortunate situation stared her again in
the face; and the news that Phyllis was worse
and was not allowed to see any one was so in
keeping with her feelings, that she felt unable
even to make a comment upon it.</p>

<p>"I always said that Miss Austen hadn't a
spark of feeling in her," observed the girl who
had given her the information; and Katharine
overheard her, and began to wonder mechanically
if it were true. Every faculty she
possessed seemed deadened at that moment;
she had no longer the inclination even to rebel
against her fate. She sat on the stairs, outside
the bedroom she was not allowed to enter, and
took a strange delicious pleasure in dwelling
upon the whole of her intercourse with Paul.
There was not a conversation or a chance
meeting with him, that she did not go through
in her mind with a scrupulous accuracy; the
pain of it became almost unendurable at moments,
and yet it was an exquisite torture that
brought her some measure of relief. She even
forced herself to recall her last meeting with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
him, and was surprised in an apathetic sort of
way when she found that she did not want to
cry any more.</p>

<p>And from thinking of Paul, she naturally
fell to thinking of Ted too. And it slowly
dawned upon her, as she considered it in the
light of her present mood, that what Polly had
said in her vulgar, uncompromising manner,
was the truth. For a whole year she had been
living in a false atmosphere of contentment;
she had deluded herself into the belief that she
was superior to convention and human nature
combined, and she had ended in proving herself
a complete failure. Paul had seen through
her self-righteousness, he had nothing but contempt
for her, and he had found it a relief to
turn from her to the human and faulty Marion
Keeley. In the depths of her self-abasement,
she had even ceased to feel angry with Marion.</p>

<p>And Ted had found her out. That was the
worst of all. On the impulse of the moment,
she fetched some paper and wrote to him at
once, sitting there on the uncarpeted stairs,
while the people passed up and down unheeded
by her. It was a very humble letter,
full of pleading confession and self-accusation,&mdash;such
a letter as she had never sent him before,
and written from a standpoint she had never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
yet been obliged to assume towards him. It
was a relief at the moment to be doing something;
but she regretted her action the whole
of the following day, and hardly knew how to
open his reply when she found it awaiting her,
on her return home in the evening. It was
very short.</p>

<p>"Dear Kitty," it ran:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Don't mind about me. It's a rotten world, and
I'm the rottenest fool in it. I was only hit up the
other night because I was so surprised. Of course
you're all right, and I ought never to have been born.
I knew all the time that you were spoofing me when
you pretended to care for me; but I didn't know you
cared for any one else, least of all Wilton. He always
seemed so played to me, but then I'm not clever.
Only, I advise you not to go hanging round his chambers
at night; people are so poor, and they might talk.
Let me know if you want me or anything. I won't
bother you otherwise.</p>

<p class="left65">
<span class="smcap">Ted.</span></p>
</div>

<p>He still believed in her, then; only it was
more from habit than conviction. But she
had destroyed his love for her. She realised
these two facts in the same breath, and she
rebelled passionately at the loss of the affection
that had been hers for so long, though
she had valued it so lightly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span></p>

<p>"I do want you, now," she scribbled to him
in pencil. "Will you come here to-morrow
evening? Miss Jennings has promised me
the use of her sitting-room. I shall expect
you about seven."</p>

<p>It seemed quite in harmony with the general
wretchedness of those few days that Phyllis
should be seriously ill all the time. The
sixty-three working gentlewomen, who had
never pretended to care for the brusque shorthand
clerk when she was in good health and
trampled without a scruple on their tenderest
susceptibilities, now went about on tiptoe, and
conversed in whispers on all the landings, and
got in the way of the doctor when he came
downstairs. And they one and all condemned
Katharine for her indifference, because she refused
to enlarge on the subject at every meal.</p>

<p>"The conversation is never very exhilarating,
at the best of times; but when all those
women take to gloating over a tragedy, it
simply isn't bearable," she was heard to
exclaim; and the unlucky remark cost her
the last shred of her popularity at Queen's
Crescent.</p>

<p>She was waiting at her usual post on the
stairs, when they came to tell her that Ted
was downstairs. He had come at her bidding;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
that was consoling, at all events. But when
she walked into Miss Jennings' private room
and saw his face as he stood on the hearthrug,
her heart sank again, and she knew that she
was not to find consolation yet. He held
out his hand to her silently, and pulled forward
a slender, white-wood chair tied up with
yellow ribbons, and imperilled a bamboo screen
crowded with cheap crockery, and finally sat
down himself on the edge of the chintz-covered
sofa. Neither of them spoke for a
moment or two, and Ted cleared his throat
uncomfortably, and stared at the ferrule of his
walking-stick.</p>

<p>"I got your letter," he said at last, "and
I've come."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Katharine, "you've come."</p>

<p>Having delivered themselves of these two
very obvious remarks, they again relapsed
into silence; and Katharine glanced at the
cuckoo clock, and marvelled that so much
concentrated wretchedness could be crowded
into something under five minutes.</p>

<p>"Ted," she forced herself to say, in a voice
that did not seem to be hers, "Ted, will you
never come and see me any more?"</p>

<p>He lifted his head and looked at her; then
looked away again.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span></p>

<p>"Not unless you want me to do anything
for you," he said. "I don't want to bother,
you see."</p>

<p>She longed to cry out and tell him that he
never bothered her; that she wanted to see
him more than she wanted anything in the
whole world. But something new and strange
in his face, that told her he was no longer a
boy and no longer her willing slave, seemed
to paralyse her. To be proved inferior to
the man she had always considered inferior
to her, was the hardest blow she had yet had to
endure.</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean," she said,
lamely.</p>

<p>Ted hastened to be apologetic.</p>

<p>"I'm beastly sorry," he said, and cleared
his throat again.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I wish you would explain," she
went on.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right, isn't it?" said Ted
vaguely.</p>

<p>"It isn't all right; you know it isn't," she
cried. "What makes you so strange to me?
You've never looked like that before. Is it
I who have changed you so, Ted?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's nothing," he said. "You've
hit me up rather, that's all. Don't bother
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
about me. Did you want me for anything
particular?"</p>

<p>She looked in vain for any signs of relenting
in his manner; but he sat on the edge
of the sofa, and played with his walking-stick,
and cleared his throat at intervals. In spite
of the changed conditions of their attitude
towards one another, she felt that she was expected,
as usual, to take the initiative.</p>

<p>"I wanted to tell you all about it, to explain,"
she faltered. "I thought you would
help me."</p>

<p>"If it's all the same to you, I would rather
not hear," said Ted, with unexpected promptitude.
"I know as much about it as I care
to know, thanks. <i>He</i> wrote to me this morning,
too."</p>

<p>"He wrote to you? Paul?"</p>

<p>"Wilton, yes," he replied, shortly, and
glanced at her again. His under lip was
twitching, as it always did when he was hurt
or embarrassed.</p>

<p>"What for?" she asked, wonderingly.</p>

<p>"Oh, to explain, and all that! Hang the
explanation! I didn't want him to tell me
he hadn't been a blackguard; I knew you,&mdash;so
that was all square. But I don't understand
it now, and I don't want to. I can't
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
see any great shakes, myself, in playing about
with a girl when you're engaged to some
one else. But I suppose that's because I'm
such a rotten ass. It's none of my business,
any way; only, I think you'd better
be careful. But you know best, so that's all
right."</p>

<p>Again she longed to tell him that she was
not so bad as he thought her, and yet, much
worse than he thought her; but the words
would not come, and she sat self-condemned.</p>

<p>"You don't understand," she stammered
presently. "I didn't know he was engaged
till yesterday. I saw no harm in it all;
I only liked him very much, as a friend. I
liked you in quite a different way, I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You didn't know he was engaged?" said
Ted, rousing himself suddenly. "Do you
mean to say he has been playing fast and
loose with you, the blackguard? If I had
thought that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no!" she cried, in alarm at the fierceness
of his expression. "He never treated
me badly; he made everything quite clear
from the beginning. It was my fault if I
misunderstood him. But I never did; I always
knew we were just friends, and it was pleasant,
and I let it go on. Haven't you and I been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
friends, too, Ted? There was no harm in
that, was there?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," he said, bitterly. "There was
no fear of any harm in it!"</p>

<p>She realised his meaning, and blushed painfully
as she felt that he had spoken the truth.</p>

<p>"Ted, do you hate me, I wonder?" she
murmured.</p>

<p>"What? Oh, that's all right. Don't
bother about me. I was a rotten ass ever to
expect anything else."</p>

<p>"But, I mean, because&mdash;because of the
other?" she went on anxiously.</p>

<p>Ted bit his lip, but did not speak.</p>

<p>"Do you think it was wrong of me?" she
pleaded. "Ted, tell me! I didn't know;
I didn't really. It seemed quite right to me;
I couldn't see that it mattered, just because
of what people said. Would you think it
wrong of a girl to come and see you, if she
liked coming, and didn't care what people
said?"</p>

<p>Ted rose from his seat hurriedly, and
picked up his hat.</p>

<p>"I never said you were wrong, did I?" he
said, gently. "You see, you're clever, and
I'm not, and it's altogether different. I was
only sorry, that was all; I didn't think you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
went in for that sort of thing, and I was hit up,
rather. But it was my fault entirely; and
of course you're right,&mdash;you always are. I
sha'n't bother you any more, now I know."</p>

<p>"Ted, don't go," she said, imploringly, as
he touched her hand again and turned towards
the door. "Don't you understand, Ted, that&mdash;that
<i>he</i> only appealed to half of me, and&mdash;&nbsp;I
do care, Ted, and I want you to come and
see me again; I do really, Ted, I&mdash;"</p>

<p>But he only smiled as incredulously as
before, and spoke again in the same gentle
tone.</p>

<p>"Thanks, awfully. But don't bother to
spoof yourself about me; I shall be all right,
really. It was always my fault; I won't
bother you any more. Good-bye."</p>

<p>And, haunted by his changed manner and
his joyless smile, she went back to her seat
on the stairs, and sat with her hands clasped
over her knees and her eyes staring vacantly
into space, as she tried in vain to discover
what her real feelings were. "Perhaps I
haven't got any," she thought to herself.
"Perhaps I am incapable of loving any one,
or of feeling anything. And I have sent away
the best fellow in the whole world, and it
doesn't seem to matter a bit. I wonder if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
<i>anything</i> could make me cry now?" And
she took a gloomy pleasure in conjuring up
all the incidents of the last unhappy week, and
laughed cynically when she found that none
of them had any effect upon her.</p>

<p>"Why don't they light the gas?" complained
the working gentlewomen, when they
came downstairs to supper. And when Katharine
explained that she had promised to light
it herself and had forgotten to do so, they
passed on their way, marvelling that any one
with so little feeling should have her moments
of abstraction like every one else. After they
had all gone down, she had a restless fit, and
paced up and down the landing until Polly
Newland came out of the sick room, and
stopped her.</p>

<p>"You might choose another landing, if you
want to do that," she said, crossly. "You've
woke her up now; but you can come in
if you like. She has just asked for you."</p>

<p>Katharine followed her in, rather awkwardly,
and sat down on the chair that was pointed
out to her, and tried to think of something
appropriate to say. It was difficult to know
how to begin, when she looked round the
room, and noted all the objects that seemed
to have belonged to some distant period in her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
life, before the world had become so hard and
cheerless. But Phyllis was looking the same
as ever, except that she was rather white, and
her hair was strangely tidy. She was the first
to speak.</p>

<p>"Hullo," she said. "I've been wanting
to see you. What's the matter with you,
child?"</p>

<p>The incongruity of being asked by the
invalid for the cause of her own malady did
not immediately occur to Katharine. But the
familiar tone of sympathy went straight to her
heart, and she broke down completely. She
had a dim notion that Polly remonstrated
angrily, and that Polly was sent out of the
room; and after that she was conscious of
nothing except of the comfort of being able
to cry undisturbed, until Phyllis said something
about red eyes, and they joined in a
spasmodic laugh.</p>

<p>"Poor old girl, what have they been doing
to you?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Everything has been horrid," gasped
Katharine. "And you were ill, and nobody
understood, and oh, Phyllis!&mdash;I am a <i>prig</i>!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p>Marion Keeley lay in an indolent attitude
on the sofa by the window. Her mother was
addressing circulars at the writing-table, with
the anxious haste of the fashionable woman of
business. Both of them looked as though the
London season, which a royal wedding had prolonged
this year, had been too much for them.</p>

<p>"He is coming again to-night," said Marion,
throwing down a letter she had been reading.
Her tone was one of dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>"I know," replied her mother. "I asked
him to come."</p>

<p>Marion made a gesture of impatience.</p>

<p>"Don't you think," she said, "that you
might occasionally, for the sake of variety, wait
until his own inclination prompted him to
come?"</p>

<p>"I don't understand you," said Mrs. Keeley,
absently. "I asked him because I wanted to
make final arrangements with him about Lady
Suffolk's drawing-room meeting, at which he
has promised to speak to-morrow."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span></p>

<p>"It seems to me," observed Marion sarcastically,
"that it would save a lot of trouble if
you were to marry him yourself."</p>

<p>"It is very surprising," complained her
mother, "how you persist in dragging the
frivolous element into everything. If you
were only like your cousin, now,&mdash;so earnest
and so sympathetic! How is it that you are
really my daughter?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know; in fact, I think it
is the only subject on which you have allowed
me to remain ignorant," returned Marion,
calmly. "But you needn't bother about me;
I am going out to dinner in any case to-night,
so you will be able to make your arrangements
with Paul without the distraction of the frivolous
element. Meanwhile, can't we have
some tea?"</p>

<p>The Honourable Mrs. Keeley returned to
her circulars with a sigh.</p>

<p>"One might almost think, to hear you talk,
that you did not want to marry him at all," she
exclaimed.</p>

<p>"One almost might," assented Marion; and
she tore her letter into little pieces, and threw
them deftly into the waste-paper basket. Her
mother looked at her a little apprehensively.</p>

<p>"How you can, even in fun, pretend to ignore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
the merits of a character like Paul Wilton's
is beyond my comprehension," she grumbled.
"What more can you want in a man, I should
like to know?"</p>

<p>"More? I don't want any more; I want a
good deal less. I'm not ignoring his merits; I
only wish I could. I would give anything to
find a few honest human imperfections in him.
It is his eternal excellence that is driving me to
distraction. What a fool I was ever to let him
take me seriously! Of course I never should
have done, if he had not provoked me by
being so difficult to fascinate. He is one of
those awful people who are going to make
heaven unbearable!"</p>

<p>"Judging by your aggravating behaviour
in this world, you won't be there to help him,"
said her mother, who was losing her patience
rapidly after having wrongly addressed two
wrappers.</p>

<p>"I hope I sha'n't. If all the people go to
heaven who are popularly supposed to be <i>en
route</i>, I should think even the saints would be
too bored to stop there. As for Paul, I grant
you that he is eminently fitted for a son-in-law,
but I don't see why I should be the victim of
his heaven-sent vocation."</p>

<p>"You are not married to him yet; and if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
you continue in this strain much longer, I
doubt if you ever will be."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Marion, with sudden animation,
"do you really think there <i>is</i> a chance of his
breaking it off?"</p>

<p>The opportune arrival of Katharine at this
moment restored some of Mrs. Keeley's good-humour.
She approved very decidedly of
Katharine, not only because she was a working-woman,
but also on account of her patience as
a listener. Katharine, she felt, would have
made an ideal daughter; Katharine understood
the serious aspect of the political situation,
and she showed no signs of being
bored when people gave her their opinion of
things. So she received her with genuine
cordiality.</p>

<p>"I am so glad you have come," said Marion,
offering her a perfunctory embrace. "You
have interrupted mamma, and made tea inevitable.
It is quite providential."</p>

<p>"I am glad to be the unwitting cause of so
many blessings," said Katharine drily. "I
really came to say good-bye. I am going
home to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Holidays already?" exclaimed Mrs. Keeley,
as though she grudged even the working gentlewoman
her moments of relaxation.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span></p>

<p>"They have not come too soon for me,"
observed Katharine, to whom the last six
weeks had seemed an endless period of waiting.
"But I am leaving town for good; so I suppose
I shall not see you again for some time. I mean
to say, I have given up my teaching, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How charming of you!" exclaimed Marion,
who felt that the last barrier to a warm friendship
with her cousin was now removed. "Are
you really going to be like everybody else,
now?"</p>

<p>But the Honourable Mrs. Keeley was bitterly
disappointed.</p>

<p>"It is incredible," she said. "Do you mean
to say that you are going to throw up your
life's work, just as you are on the point of
being a brilliant success?"</p>

<p>"I think, on the contrary, I have merely been
a failure," said Katharine, with a patient smile.
"You see, there are hundreds of people who
can do just what I am doing. But I am
wanted at home, and I am going back to my
father; I ought never to have left him."</p>

<p>"Oh, these girls!" sighed Mrs. Keeley.
"What is the use of trying to make them
independent? And I thought you were so
different; I held you up as an example to my
own daughter&mdash;"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span></p>

<p>"I am so sorry," murmured Katharine, in
parenthesis. Marion only laughed.</p>

<p>"I was proud to own you as my niece,"
pursued Mrs. Keeley, increasing in fervour
as she went on. "You were doing what so
few women succeed in doing, and I had the
keenest admiration for your courage and your
talent. And to give it all up like this!
Surely, you have some excellent reason for
such an extraordinary course of action?"</p>

<p>"It seems to me quite sufficient reason
that I am more wanted at home than here,"
replied Katharine, with the same air of
gentle endurance. She had gone through
a similar explanation more than once lately,
and it was beginning to blunt the edge of
her newly made resolutions. It also took
away most of the picturesqueness of being
good.</p>

<p>"But, indeed, you are very much mistaken,"
her aunt continued to urge. "Who
has been putting this effete notion of <i>duty</i>
into your head? I thought we working-women
had buried it for ever! Consider what
you are doing in throwing up the position you
have carved out for yourself; consider the
bad effect it will have upon others, the example,&mdash;everything!
Your place is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
world, Kitty, the great world! There cannot
be any work for you to do in a home like
yours."</p>

<p>"There is always plenty to do in the village,
and nobody to do it," said Katharine.
"I have considered the matter thoroughly,
Aunt Alicia, and my mind is quite made up.
Anybody can do my work up here in London;
you know that is so."</p>

<p>"Indeed, you are mistaken," said her aunt,
vehemently. It seemed particularly hard that
her favourite protégée should have deserted
her principles, just as she had been driven to
the last limit of endurance by her own daughter.
"Every woman must do her own work, and
no one else can do it for her."</p>

<p>"Then why do you always say the labour
market is so overcrowded?" asked Marion,
making a mischievous application of the
knowledge she had so unwillingly absorbed.
But she was not heeded.</p>

<p>"It is the mass we have to consider, not
the individual," continued the Honourable
Mrs. Keeley, as though she were addressing
the room from a platform. "It is for lesser
women than ourselves to look after the home
and the parish; there is a far wider sphere reserved
for such as you and I. It would be a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
perfect scandal if you were to throw yourself away
on the narrowness of the domestic circle."</p>

<p>Katharine felt a hysterical desire to laugh,
which she controlled with difficulty. She spoke
very humbly, instead.</p>

<p>"It must be my own fault, if I have allowed
you to think all these things about me," she
said. "There is nothing great reserved for
me; I am just a complete failure, and that is
the end of all my ambition and all my conceit.
I wish some one had told me I was
conceited, before I got so bad."</p>

<p>The Honourable Mrs. Keeley was silenced
at last. None of her experience of working
gentlewomen helped her to meet the present
situation. A woman with a great future before
her had obviously no right to be humble.
But Marion realised gleefully that she had
gained a new and unexpected ally.</p>

<p>"I always said you were much too jolly to belong
to mamma's set," she observed; at which
the angered feelings of her mother compelled
her to seek comfort in solitude, and she made
some excuse for retiring to her boudoir, and
left the two rebels together. They looked at
one another and broke into mutual merriment.
But Marion laughed the loudest,&mdash;a
fact that she herself was the first to appreciate.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span></p>

<p>"Kitty," she said suddenly, growing grave,
"I am so sorry, dear! What's up, and who
has been treating you badly?"</p>

<p>She strolled away immediately to pour out
tea, and Katharine had time to recover from
surprise at her unusual penetration.</p>

<p>"How did you know?" she asked, slowly.</p>

<p>"I guessed, because&mdash;oh, you looked like
it, or something! Don't ask me to give a
reason for anything I say, <i>please</i>. It isn't my
business, of course, and I don't want to know
a thing about it if you would rather not tell;
only, I'm sorry if you're cut up, that's all.
Did you chuck him, or did it never get so far
as that? There, I really don't want you to tell
me about it. Of course, he was much older
than you, and much wickeder, and he flirted
atrociously with you and you were taken in
by him, you poor little innocent dear! I
know all about it, and the way they get hold
of girls like you who are not up to their
wiles. He was married, too, of course? They
always are, the worst ones."</p>

<p>It was too much trouble to correct her assumptions,
and Katharine allowed her to go
on. After all, her sympathy was genuine, if
it was a little crudely expressed.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't think any more about him,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
if I were you," continued Marion. "They're
not worth it, any of them; go and get another,
and snap your fingers at the first. You're
not tied to one, as I am."</p>

<p>"No," said Katharine, scalding herself with
mouthfuls of boiling tea. "I'm not."</p>

<p>"I know I would give anything to get rid
of mine," said Marion sorrowfully. "May
you never know the awful monotony of being
engaged!"</p>

<p>"I don't fancy I ever shall," observed
Katharine.</p>

<p>"Always the same writing on the breakfast
table," sighed Marion; "always the
same face on the back seat of the carriage;
always the same photograph all over the
house,&mdash;oh, it's maddening! You wouldn't
be able to stand it for a day, Kitty!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," said Katharine. "Then your
engagement is publicly announced now?"</p>

<p>"I should rather think so! I am tired of
being congratulated by a lot of idiots, who
don't even take the trouble to find out
whether I want to be married or not. And
then, the boys! Bobby is going to shoot
himself, he says; but of course Bobby always
says that. And Jack has gone to South Africa;
I don't exactly know why, except that every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
one goes to South Africa when there isn't
any particular reason for staying in town.
And Tommy&mdash;you remember Tommy, don't
you? He was my best boy for ever so
long; I rather liked Tommy. Well, he has
gone and married that stupid Ethel Humphreys,
and he always said she <i>pinched</i>.
I know why he did it, too. He was being
objectionably serious, one day, and said he
would do anything on earth for me; so I
asked him to go and marry mamma, because
then I should get eight hundred a year.
And he didn't like it a bit; Tommy always
was ridiculously hot-tempered. Oh, dear,
I'm sick of it all! I believe you're the
only person I know, who hasn't congratulated
me."</p>

<p>"Apparently, you do not consider yourself
a subject for congratulation," said Katharine,
smiling faintly.</p>

<p>"Oh, you're not like all the others, and
I should like to be congratulated by you.
You would mean what you said, anyhow."</p>

<p>"I certainly should," exclaimed Katharine.</p>

<p>"How earnestly you said that! It's frightfully
nice of you to care so much, though. I
was telling Paul what a good sort you were,
the other day, and he quite agreed."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span></p>

<p>"Wasn't it rather dull for him?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, I'm sure it wasn't; he takes a
tremendous interest in you; he says you are
the cleverest woman he knows, and the pluckiest.
He does, really!"</p>

<p>"I have no doubt of it. He has always
thought me clever and plucky," said Katharine.</p>

<p>"Well, it's more than he thinks about me,
anyhow," said Marion ruefully. "He doesn't
think I am good for anything, except to play
with."</p>

<p>"And to fall in love with," added Katharine
softly.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you come and meet him the
other evening?" continued Marion. "He
seemed so disappointed. So was I; I wanted
you to come, for lots of reasons. I get so
bored when I am left alone with him! I like
him ever so much better if there is some one
else there; and you are the only girl I know
who would be safe not to flirt with him.
Bobby said, only the other day, that you were
much too nice to flirt with. And girls are so
mean, sometimes,&mdash;aren't they? I was really
sorry when you refused."</p>

<p>"If you had told me the real reason for your
invitation, instead of the conventional one, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
might have made more effort to come," said
Katharine.</p>

<p>"You old dear, don't be sarcastic; I never
can endure sarcasm. But you will come next
time, won't you? Oh, dear, I am forgetting
all about your own trouble; what a selfish
wretch I am! Are you sure there is nothing
I can do for you?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, thanks; at least, nothing I would
let you do."</p>

<p>"Sure? Well, let me know if there is. Are
you really very gone on him, Kitty?"</p>

<p>"Please don't," said Katharine.</p>

<p>"All right, I won't. But I wish you would
try a course of boys for a time; it would make
you feel so much happier. They're so fresh
and harmless."</p>

<p>"Even when they shoot themselves?" said
Katharine.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's only Bobby. Must you really
go? You old dear, you have done me such a
lot of good. What is it, Williams?"</p>

<p>Mr. Wilton was in the library, the man
announced, and would be glad to see either
Mrs. Keeley or her daughter for a moment,
and he would rather not come upstairs, as he
was in a hurry. Marion gave a petulant little
stamp.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, send mamma to him! How like Paul,
not to care which of us he sees! Just fancy,
if it were Tommy, now! Stop, though, show
him up here, Williams. You will be able to
congratulate him, Kitty; it will put him in a
good humour. Oh, nonsense! you can wait
just for that, and I haven't anything to say to
him that he hasn't heard hundreds of times
before."</p>

<p>So Katharine found herself shaking hands
with him once more, and congratulating him
on being engaged to her cousin, Marion
Keeley. She had not seen him since the
night of the thunderstorm, when he had stood
in the old doorway in Essex Court, with the
lamplight on his face.</p>

<p>"You are very good; it is kind of you to
take so much interest," he was saying with
frigid politeness.</p>

<p>They were silent after that, and Marion said
she was sure they must have crowds to talk
about, and she would go upstairs and ask her
mother about Lady Suffolk's drawing-room
meeting; and they both made perfectly futile
efforts to keep her in the room, and were
ashamed of having made them when she had
gone, and they were left to face the situation
alone.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span></p>

<p>"I suppose," said Paul, with an effort, "that
your holidays will soon be beginning?"</p>

<p>"They have begun to-day," said Katharine.
"This is the first day&mdash;of my last holidays."</p>

<p>"Your&mdash;last holidays?" She felt, without
seeing, that he had looked up sharply at her.</p>

<p>"I don't suppose it will interest you," she
went on, rousing herself to be more explicit;
"but I am giving up my work in London, and
going home for good."</p>

<p>There was the slightest perceptible pause
before he spoke.</p>

<p>"Would you care to tell me why?"</p>

<p>"Because," said Katharine slowly, "I happened
to find out, through a friend, that I was
a prig; and I am going home to try and learn
not to be a prig any more." She was looking
straight at him as she finished speaking. His
face was quite incomprehensible just then.</p>

<p>"Was that a true friend?" he asked.</p>

<p>"People who tell us unpleasant things about
ourselves are always said to be our true friends,
are they not?" she said, evasively.</p>

<p>"That is not an answer to my question; I
was not dealing in generalities when I asked
it. But of course, you have every right to
withhold the answer, if it pleases you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't think I know the answer," said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
Katharine. "I have always found your questions
too difficult to answer; and as to this
one,&mdash;I wish I could be sure that it was a
friend at all." He moved his chair, involuntarily,
a little nearer hers.</p>

<p>"Can I do anything to make you feel more
sure?" he asked.</p>

<p>She shook her head, and he moved away
again. "Of course, you are the best judge in
the matter," he resumed, more naturally;
"but it is rather a serious step to take at the
outset of your career, is it not?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps," she said, indifferently; "but
then, I am not a man, you see. There is no
career possible for a woman, because her feelings
are always more important to her than all
the ambition in the world. A man only draws
on his feelings for his recreation; but a woman
makes them the whole business of her life,
and that is why she never gets on. I don't
suppose you can realise this, because it is so
different for you. Everybody expects a man to
get on; it is made comparatively easy for him,
and nobody ever disputes his way of doing it.
A man can have as much fun as he likes, as
long as he isn't found out,&mdash;and it's easy for
a man not to be found out," she added, with a
sigh.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span></p>

<p>"Easier than for a woman?" He spoke in
the bantering tone that was so familiar to her.</p>

<p>"Oh, a woman is dogged by detectives from
her cradle, mostly drawn from the ranks of her
own sex. It is a compliment we pay ourselves,
in one sense. We dare not inquire into the
private life of a man, because of the iniquities
he is supposed to practise; but there is so little
scandal attached to a woman's name, that
we are anxious not to miss any of it." She
laughed at her small attempt to be frivolous,
and Paul brightened considerably. He could
understand her when she was in this mood,
and his peace of mind was undisturbed by it.</p>

<p>"I suppose the man is still unborn who
will take the trouble to champion his sex, and
explain that men are not all profligates before
they are married," he observed. "I wonder
why women always think of us as cads, and
then take us for husbands. I can't think why
they want to marry us at all, though."</p>

<p>"And we can't think what reason there is
for you to offer <i>us</i> marriage, unless you do it
for position or something like that," retorted
Katharine, and then bit her lip and stopped
short, as she realised what she had said. In
the embarrassing pause that followed, Marion
came back into the room.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, you two don't look as though you'd
had much conversation," she remarked.</p>

<p>"We haven't," said Katharine, getting up
to leave. "Mr. Wilton's conversation, you
see, is all bespoken already."</p>

<p>"Miss Austen is a little hard on me," said
Paul. "I have had so little practice in conversation
with brilliant and learned young lecturers,
that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That I will leave you to a less dismal companion,"
interrupted Katharine, a little abruptly.</p>

<p>"Will you allow me to suggest," he went
on, as he held her hand for a moment, "that
you should try and think more kindly of the
particular friend who was so unpleasantly frank
to you?"</p>

<p>"If I thought that the friend in question
were likely to be affected by my opinion of
him, perhaps I might," she said, as she turned
away.</p>

<p>When she had gone, Marion asked him
what he had meant.</p>

<p>"Merely a passing reflection on something
she had been telling me," was his reply.</p>

<p>"Oh," said Marion, "did she tell you about
her love affair?"</p>

<p>"My dear girl, Miss Austen is not likely to
favour me with these interesting disclosures, is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
she? I didn't know she had a love affair, as
you rather frankly express it."</p>

<p>"She isn't a bit the sort, is she? I only
found it out this afternoon; he's an awful
beast, I should think,&mdash;led her on, and treated
her villainously, poor old Kitty! Isn't it a
shame?"</p>

<p>"Did she tell you all that?"</p>

<p>"Don't look so surprised! Of course she
did; at least, I guessed, because she looked so
miserable. I always know; I've had so much
experience, you see. But it's much worse for
Kitty, don't you know, because she takes
things so seriously. It's a mistake, isn't it?
I would give a good lot to meet the man who
has ill treated her, though!"</p>

<p>"Yes? What would you do to him?"</p>

<p>"I would tell him he was a horrid little
bounder, and that Kitty was well rid of him."</p>

<p>"In which case there is no occasion to pity
her, is there?"</p>

<p>"Oh, how unsympathetic you are! Of
course it's just as bad, whatever the man is
like. It's always the saints like Kitty who
break their hearts for the most worthless men.
I'm not made like that; I should soon console
myself with some one else, and make the
first one mad. But then, I'm not clever."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span></p>

<p>"Your cousin is a most interesting psychological
study," said Paul vaguely.</p>

<p>"What do you mean? She is a very nice
girl indeed," cried Marion indignantly; and
Paul silently condemned the whole sex, without
reservation.</p>

<p>It was a particularly bright and sunny evening
when Katharine returned to her home,&mdash;a
failure. She felt that, to be appropriate, it
should have been dull and dreary; but it was
on the contrary quite at variance with her feelings,
and she grew unaccountably happier in
spite of herself, as the train sped past the familiar
landmarks on the way and brought her
nearer every minute to the home of her childhood.
For there was a sneaking consideration
for herself in her sudden desire to serve others;
she had felt out of tune with the world since it
had been the means of revealing her deficiencies
to herself, and she longed for the panacea of
home sympathy, which was still connected in
her mind with the days when she had been
supreme in a small circle, a circle that believed
in her if it did not precisely understand her.
She had found something wanting in the sympathies
and interests which had absorbed her
for the last two years, and she turned instinctively
to those earlier ones which may have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
offered her no great allurements at the time, but
which at least contained no rude awakenings.
She forgot the petty discomforts and frequent
annoyances of her life at home, in her present
desire for rest and peace; she was tired of
fighting hard for her happiness and gaining
nothing but a moiety of pleasure in return;
and the weary condition of mind and body in
which she found herself at the end of it all,
probably helped her to exaggerate the advantages
of that former existence of hers, and to
mistake its monotony for restfulness.</p>

<p>She had her first disillusionment as she
hastened out of the station. It was no one's
fault that the Rector had been obliged to attend
a meeting of the archæological society, and that
Miss Esther had been detained in the village;
but they had never omitted to meet her before,
and that they should have done so on this particular
occasion which was of so much import
to her, appeared in the light of a bad omen,
and she set it down sadly as another penalty
that she was to pay for having neglected her
real duty so long. But she had yet to learn
that her ardent desire to sacrifice herself for
somebody did not bring with it the necessary
opportunity, and it was not encouraging to
discover that no one was particularly anxious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
to be the recipient of her good works, and that
her effort at well-doing was more resented by
those in authority than her previous and undisguised
course of self-indulgence. Even Miss
Esther mistrusted her enthusiasm, and evidently
looked upon it as another freak on the part of
her capricious niece, which would probably
prove as transient as the last; and Katharine
felt that she was touching the extreme limits of
her endurance in the first few days she spent
at the Rectory.</p>

<p>"It is very hard," she complained to herself
when she had been home about a week, "that
they should make it so much easier for me to
be bad than good. All the same," she added,
with a touch of her old defiant spirit, "I am
going to be good, whether they like it or
not!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p>Ivingdon was one of those villages, common
to the chalk district, that cease to possess any
charm in the wet weather. The small ranges
of round-topped hills which formed the only
feature in the flat green stretches of country
entirely lost the few characteristics they possessed,
in the absence of sunshine, and presented
neither charm nor majesty in the heavy grey
atmosphere that surrounded them. The landscape
appeared even less inspiriting than usual
to Katharine, on a rainy day in the late autumn,
as she plodded through the most squalid part
of the village, and prepared to walk home
through a kind of mist that had none of the
exhilarating qualities of the stormy rain that
always appealed to her. After four months of
dull and virtuous renunciation, such a day as
this was likely to hasten the reaction that had
become inevitable. It was tea time when she
reached the Rectory; and the aspect of the
precisely arranged table, with its rigid erection
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
of double dahlias in the middle, and the
starched figure of Miss Esther at the head of
it, completed the feeling of revulsion in her
mind.</p>

<p>"My dear," said her aunt, as Katharine
flung herself into a chair, "have you no
intention of making yourself tidy before we
begin?"</p>

<p>"My only intention is that of having tea as
speedily as possible," replied Katharine. "If
Peter Bunce, or any other depressing personage
is likely to turn up, he may as well see me
in my wet weather hat as in anything else.
Besides, I rather like myself in my wet weather
hat, in spite of the disapproval it has excited
among the gods of the neighbourhood."</p>

<p>She waited instinctively for the reproof that
usually came as an accompaniment to her
criticism of the neighbourhood; but Miss
Esther for once was preoccupied, and allowed
her to go on undisturbed. "Mrs. Jones
has got another baby," continued Katharine.
"That's the seventh. And Farmer Rickard
seems to have seized the opportunity to turn
her husband off for the winter. There positively
isn't another scrap of news,&mdash;so may
I have some tea?"</p>

<p>"Talking of babies," observed the Rector,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
looking up from his book, "I heard this
morning that some one was going to be married.
Now, whoever could it have been, I
wonder!"</p>

<p>"I didn't know," said Katharine, "that
any one was left to be married in this village,
above the age of sixteen."</p>

<p>"Ah, to be sure," continued the Rector, smiling
at his unusual effort of memory, "it was
your cousin Marion. You remember Alicia
Keeley, do you not, Esther? Well, this is
her daughter; they both came to stay with
us some years ago, if you remember; and she
is to be married to a barrister, whose name&mdash;my
child, that is the third time I have passed
you the butter, and you have already helped
yourself twice&mdash;whose name is Paul Wilton.
It's very odd," he added, with his nervous
laugh, "but, although the name is perfectly
familiar to me, I do not seem to recollect the
man in the least. The only Wilton I can recall
with certainty is the exceedingly able and
scholarly author of our best work on copper
tokens; but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, this is his son, of course, Cyril,"
interrupted Miss Esther impatiently. "I
should not have thought it required much
effort to remember the man who enjoyed your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
hospitality for at least two months. A very
nice young man he was, too,&mdash;of an excellent
family, and with a delicate regard for propriety
which was most fortunate considering the embarrassing
circumstances in which we were placed
at the time. So he is going to marry into the
family? What a coincidence! I don't remember
much about Marion, she was so young
when she stayed here; but if she has grown
up at all like that terribly advanced mother
of hers, poor Mr. Wilton will have his hands
full. How did he meet her, I wonder? Did
you ever see him in Curzon street, Katharine?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes; they were engaged early in the
summer. But it isn't a bit important, is it?"
said Katharine.</p>

<p>"You knew they were engaged, and you
have kept it to yourself all this time?" exclaimed
her aunt. "I really think you are the
most exasperating girl, Katharine!"</p>

<p>"Why? I suppose it is rather cruel, though,
to rob any one of the smallest piece of gossip,
in a place like this," observed Katharine
sarcastically.</p>

<p>"To be sure! to be sure! I remember him
perfectly," the Rector was chuckling gleefully.
"A delightful young fellow, with some knowledge
of Oriental china. We must send them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
a little present, my dear,&mdash;something he would
be able to appreciate. There is a delightful
Elizabethan chest at Walker's&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I see no necessity for a wedding present
at all," interrupted Miss Esther. "We only
know him very slightly, and we haven't seen
the Keeleys for years. If Katharine likes to
send her cousin a little remembrance, that is
her own affair and she can do as she likes,"
she added, with a princely condescension. "I
really wonder, Cyril, that you can make such
an extravagant suggestion, with the poor crying
out at your very doors!"</p>

<p>The Rector reflected on the beauty of the old
oak chest he had coveted for weeks, and sighed
deeply. Katharine roused herself, and laughed
in a distinctly forced manner.</p>

<p>"Send them your blessing, auntie," she
said; "and congratulate Mr. Wilton on his
good fortune in entering our particular family.
I am sure it must be an alliance he has coveted
ever since he first made our acquaintance! It
will only cost a penny stamp, and I am sure
the poor of the village will not grudge that
for such a laudable object. Hey-day, do let
us talk about something else! Do you know
the Grange is put up for sale?"</p>

<p>"You don't say so!" exclaimed Miss Esther,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
who was as easily diverted as a child. "Dear
me! and poor Mrs. Morton hardly laid to her
last rest! The want of feeling that that young
Edward has shown throughout is almost incredible.
To requite the lifelong devotion of
his mother by selling her old home a month
after her death! Ah, well, I suppose we have
all done our work here, and it is time for us to
follow her!"</p>

<p>"What rubbish!" cried Katharine hotly.
"Why should he pretend to be fond of his
mother just because she is dead? She was
never a bit fond of him, when she was alive,
and he wanted her affection badly enough then.
Besides, it can't matter to her whether the
house is sold or not, and I expect he wants
the money."</p>

<p>"Money? Why, she has left him every
penny she had,&mdash;so what more can he want?
I know she did, for a fact, because the housekeeper
told me so."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't dream of disputing such an
excellent authority, but I do know her generosity
was purely accidental, and that she would
have made another will if she had not been
taken ill so suddenly," said Katharine, getting
up and walking to the window. The view
outside, with the sodden lawn and the dripping
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
trees, was as cheerless as the conversation
within.</p>

<p>"The house ought not to be allowed to
stand," said the Rector, with an indignation that
he never bestowed on the human imperfections
so bitterly deplored by his sister. "A wretched
modern thing, belonging to the very worst
period of domestic art!"</p>

<p>"They are doing it up," said Katharine
from the window. "I wonder," she added
softly to the sodden lawn and the dripping
trees, "if he knows that they have mended the
gap in the hedge?" Perhaps it was only the
dulness of the weather that was depressing her,
but her eyes, as she laid her cheek against the
window-pane, were full of tears. Miss Esther
continued her speculations unconsciously.</p>

<p>"I suppose he will travel," she said. "It
amounts to seven hundred a year, the housekeeper
told me; and I'm sure it's seven
hundred more than he deserves, the unfeeling
fellow!"</p>

<p>"It isn't his fault that he didn't get on
with his mother," said Katharine. "People
can't choose their relations, can they? And
I'm sure, under the present system, every
obstacle is put in the way of our hitting it
off with our own people."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span></p>

<p>She was almost surprised at her own vehemence
in Ted's defence. She had never seen
him since the day he had called on her in
Queen's Crescent and rejected the affection
she so tardily offered him, and the smart of
that rejection was still present with her, gently
as he had expressed it; but she could no
more suppress her old instinct of protection
for him than she could control her thoughts.</p>

<p>"I find it quite impossible to understand
you, when you are in these heartless moods,"
said her aunt crossly.</p>

<p>"Am I heartless?" said Katharine, with
her eyes still full of tears. "I suppose that
must be it; I wondered what was the matter
with me this afternoon. Of course I am in
one of my heartless moods. Oh, dear, how
stupid it all is!" She sighed desperately, and
turned away from the dreary outlook. "I'm
sorry I didn't gather any more news in my
excursion to the village," she went on presently,
with an obvious effort to be agreeable. "Oh,
I forgot,&mdash;I met the doctor."</p>

<p>"Yes? What had he to say for himself?"
asked Miss Esther, whose dignity was always
subject to her curiosity.</p>

<p>"He asked me to marry him, and I refused,"
answered Katharine; and she broke
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
into a peal of laughter at the immediate effect
of her words.</p>

<p>"What? Really, Katharine, you are perfectly
incorrigible," said Miss Esther, in a
tone that was expressive rather of incredulity
than of disapproval.</p>

<p>"It's very odd," observed Katharine, "that
one has only to tell the truth to be disbelieved.
And I'm sure I was very sorry to be obliged
to refuse him, because I felt there was no one
else in the place he could possibly ask. Poor
doctor!"</p>

<p>Miss Esther said a rapid grace to show how
outraged she felt, and walked out of the room
without another word. Katharine sighed once
more and looked across at her father, who
was apparently absorbed in his book and oblivious
of what had been passing. But Katharine's
acquaintance with the world, short as it
had been, had considerably widened her vision,
and she knew somehow as she looked at him
that he was not reading at that moment.</p>

<p>"Daddy, dear daddy!" she cried, impetuously,
"I couldn't help it this afternoon, I
couldn't, really! I believe I have a devil in
me some days, and this is one of them.
Daddy, forgive me for being so selfish and
horrid; I hate myself for my abominable temper,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
I do indeed. I think I have never been
so miserable in my whole life before!"</p>

<p>"My child, what is it? I don't think I
quite understand," said the Rector gently. She
came and sat on the arm of his chair, and he
stroked her hair mechanically.</p>

<p>"Of course you don't,&mdash;how should you?"
she exclaimed, half laughing to hide the shake
in her voice. "But I wish I knew why I
have these bad fits; I would do just anything
to get better, but <i>I can't</i>! When I don't
feel wretched I feel absurd, and that's ever
so much worse. Why is it that I feel like
this, daddy?"</p>

<p>"Shall we send for the doctor?" asked
the Rector innocently; and he wondered why
she seemed amused.</p>

<p>"I don't fancy he would care to come just
yet," she said, demurely. They were silent
for a few moments. The Rector asked her
presently if she would like to go away again.</p>

<p>"I don't know; I don't seem to want anything.
Ivingdon is intolerable; but I said I
would endure it for your sake, and it seems
so feeble merely to have failed again. After
all, I haven't done the least atom of good
by giving up my work and coming home,
have I?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span></p>

<p>The Rector remembered many incidents in
the last four months, and did not contradict
her; but his silence was so habitual to him
that she hardly noticed it.</p>

<p>"Self-sacrifice is all very well in theory,"
she went on disconsolately, "but if nobody
wants you to sacrifice yourself, what's the
good of it? I don't believe there is a single
Christian virtue that works properly, when
you come to practise it; and I've wasted four
good months in finding it out. Oh, dear,
what a mortal idiot I've been! I wish you
understood, daddy," she added wistfully.</p>

<p>"I'm not sure that I don't, Kitty," he said
tentatively, and waited to be contradicted.</p>

<p>"I believe you do; I believe you always
have understood!" she cried. "But I always
expect too much from people, and I never can
take any one on trust. How I can be so
unlike you is a mystery to me."</p>

<p>"You are like your dear mother, bless her,"
said the Rector with unconscious humour;
and they became silent again.</p>

<p>"Do you know," she went on presently,
"if you'd promise not to mind, daddy, I half
think I'd like to go away again, for a while.
I've still got some money, you know, and
I might try Paris, or some new place. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
seems hopeless to stay on here, and worry
Aunt Esther by everything I do or say; I
know she considers me the cross she has to
bear, but it seems a waste of Christian resignation,
doesn't it?"</p>

<p>"Paris?" said the Rector with animation.
"By all means go to Paris,&mdash;the most delightful
place in the world! When I was a boy
in Paris&mdash;&nbsp;Dear, dear, how it all comes back
to me! That was before I was ordained, to
be sure; ah, those were days to be remembered!
I can give you an introduction to a
friend of mine in Paris, Monsieur&mdash;Monsieur&mdash;&nbsp;Ah,
it's gone now. But I can tell
you the names of all his books. A charming
fellow; knew everything and did everything;
there was nothing too daring for him in those
days. You'll get on with him, Kitty; the
most delightful companion a man could have,
in fact!" The old Rector was laughing like
a schoolboy at his reminiscences.</p>

<p>"That's all very well," said Katharine
rather cruelly; "but what will Aunt Esther
say?"</p>

<p>"Ah," said the Rector, looking about him
apprehensively, "there is certainly Esther to
be considered."</p>

<p>"Yes, there is!" sighed Katharine. And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
she added impetuously, "Poor daddy! what
a saint you must have been all these years!
I wonder why I never realised it before?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said the Rector, smiling. "I'm
nothing but an old fool, who was never fit to
have a daughter at all. Your mother ought
to have left me to vegetate among my books,
bless her heart!"</p>

<p>Katharine looked at him reflectively.</p>

<p>"I am beginning to understand," she said,
in her quaint, thoughtful manner. "It has
puzzled me all these months, but you have
made it come quite clear at last. I see now
what they meant by calling me a prig: it is
because I have none of the qualities that would
prevent you from ever becoming one."</p>

<p>"A prig?" said her father inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Ah," said Katharine, "it is something of
too modern a growth to have come within
your ken." She slipped off her seat, and
began pacing restlessly up and down the room.</p>

<p>"A prig," she continued, more to herself
than to her father, who was watching her narrowly
nevertheless, "a prig is one who tries
to break what the ordinary person is pleased
to call the law of Nature, and to substitute the
law of his own reason instead. It doesn't
matter that this is what we are brought up to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
do, for the ordinary person insists on our
forgetting that we are intelligent beings, and
only wants us to run in the same rut as himself.
And the ordinary person is very happy,
so perhaps he is right. Education makes us
all prigs, and we have to sit and wait for the
particular experience that is to undo the effects
of our education. It is great waste of time to
be educated, isn't it? We are told that it is
priggish to have ideals, and that is why being
young is generally equivalent to being priggish.
The world won't tolerate ideals; it
sneers at us for trying to find out new ways
of being good, and it likes to see us for ever
grubbing among the same old ways of being
bad. Did you know all this before, daddy?
But you never told me, did you? Do parents
ever tell their children anything useful, I wonder?
Oh, I don't think so; we just have to
go on until we find it all out, and break our
hearts over it, most likely!" She paused to
give a little bitter laugh. The Rector had an
intent look on his face that was foreign to it.
"I should like to know," she went on, more
gently, "if it isn't possible to be brave, or
steadfast, or true, without being a prig; it
simply means that we have got to go on trying
to be better than we are, and pretending that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
we don't know it all the while. It is such an
anomalous position for a thinking person, isn't
it? And yet, if we are honest about it we
proclaim ourselves prigs at once. <i>I</i> am a
prig, daddy. Did you know that too? I
have gloried all my life in being above the
ordinary littlenesses of womanhood; and then,
when my hour came, I just learned that I was
the same old woman after all. I was proud
of knowing so much, and all the time I did
not know what every ignorant woman in the
world could have told me. Oh, the world is
right, after all; I know it! But it has such
uncomfortable ways of convincing us, hasn't
it? I'm not bothering you, daddy, am I?"
She stopped, and looked at him anxiously.
The Rector did not speak. "Nothing will
ever make you a prig," continued Katharine
as she resumed her restless walk, "or Ted
either, or Marion Keeley. Lovable people
are never priggish, are they? Oh, I am never
going to try to be anything, again. I shall
become as much like the ordinary person as I
can; I will let boys like Monty make love to
me, and pretend that I like it; I will let
myself go, and hide away my old feelings
which were real ones, and invent a whole set
of new ones for everyday use. Oh, dear, how
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
absurd it all is! To make one's life a long
course of deception, in order to prove to the
world that we are real! And yet, that is the
only way to avoid being called a prig. It is
ridiculous to pretend that we care for what
the big people think of us. We don't. It is
the little, commonplace, ordinary folk, with the
commonplace minds and the commonplace
views, who make up our audience; and we
acknowledge it all our lives by being afraid of
their criticism. We play to them, and to them
only, from the moment we begin to think for
ourselves, until Providence is good enough to
ring down the curtain. We make a wretched
compromise with our real selves, in order to
get through life without being laughed at for
taking it seriously. And the end of it all is
that we have to suffer our own contempt,
instead of the commonplace person's. But
everybody does the same, so it must be right,
mustn't it? Daddy," she added suddenly, as
she came to a standstill before him, "daddy, do
you think, if I don't try to be good any more,
that I shall ever become just an ordinary
pleasant person,&mdash;someone whom people will
care to fall in love with? It would be so
comforting to feel that people cared to fall in
love with me. I am so tired of being thought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
clever and nothing else; cleverness seems like
a kind of blight that helps one to miss the
biggest thing in life. At least, I have missed
it, and everybody says I am clever. Why
don't you answer me, daddy? Why, daddy!
I&mdash;I do believe you're crying!"</p>

<p>"No, my child, you are mistaken," said
Cyril Austen hastily. "I have been overworking
my eyes lately, that is all. You
mustn't talk like that, little girl; it&mdash;it makes
me unhappy. I should never have allowed
you to go away by yourself, should I? I'm a
useless old&mdash;&nbsp;But there, it is too late now.
Let us talk about this Paris plan of yours.
What if I were to come too, eh?"</p>

<p>"It would be beautiful!" cried Katharine.
"But there is still Aunt Esther, isn't there?"</p>

<p>"Ah, yes!" said the Rector ruefully. "So
stupid of me to forget!"</p>

<p>They made themselves very happy for a
day or two over the Paris plan. They met
like guilty conspirators when Miss Esther was
out of the way, and amused themselves by
arranging a scheme which they knew quite
well she would never allow them to carry out.
Katharine's spirits recovered something of
their old vigour; and Miss Esther felt more
bewildered than ever when she suddenly appeared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
in this new mood, and refused to have
anything more to do with the parish.</p>

<p>"I am tired of good works," she announced
vigorously. "They don't answer, and they
destroy one's self-respect. Some people are
cut out for that sort of thing, but I am not,
and I am going to leave it to those who are.
I am never again going to make myself uncomfortable
by visiting people in their unpleasant
homes. I don't want to go, for one thing; and
it isn't good for them to be patronised, for
another. Besides, they can't refuse to see me
in any case, and I don't like forcing myself
upon people in that uninvited manner. I am
going to be happy in my own way, and that
will give them a much fairer chance of being
happy in theirs. I've done with the whole
thing." And she returned cheerfully to the
map of Paris.</p>

<p>But her new-found contentment was not to
be allowed a long duration. A letter came for
her a few days later, which altered the whole
aspect of affairs, and finally quenched the
Paris plan. The writing was unfamiliar to
her, and she had to turn to the end of the
closely written pages to discover who had sent
it to her.</p>

<p>"Dear Miss Austen," it ran:&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"It may be a matter of great surprise to you to hear
from me in this unexpected manner. Nothing but
the deep interest I feel in one who is, I have reason
to believe, as great a friend of yours as of mine would
give me the courage to take up my pen and write to
you. I have for some time past been observing Ted's
career with distress, if not with the deepest concern.
You probably know that he gave up his work in the
city on the death of Mrs. Morton, so I will not
trouble you with more details than necessity compels
you to hear. Of course you will understand the diffidence
with which I approach you on so delicate a
matter; but my great friendship, or what I might call
our <i>mutual</i> friendship, for Ted Morton has given me
the requisite courage. I do not know the reason for
what I am about to break to you; in fact, to be
explicit, I have not the slightest idea of what led him
to take such a step, but I have my own conjectures
about the matter, and these I will lay before you as
briefly as the occasion demands. For some time
past, indeed, I may say for months, he has been very
depressed, and has tried to drown his trouble, whatever
it might be, in distractions of various kinds. Do
not for one moment suppose that I am making any
insinuation detrimental to Ted's reputation; far from
it! But there is no doubt that he has grown somewhat
reckless in disposition, owing possibly to this
same mysterious trouble of his, and this has hurried
on the crisis which it is now my business to communicate
to you. But to avoid unnecessary details,
let me at once tell you in plain language what has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
happened to him. Three days ago I met him in the
Strand about seven o'clock, and asked him to come
and dine with me. He refused, with none of the
punctilious courtesy that usually characterises him,
and I left him thinking, strange as it might seem, that
he preferred to be alone. But on going to look him
up at his chambers last night, I found him in the condition
which it has become my obvious duty to
describe to you. Fortunately, the ingenuous disposition,
which has made him feel his trouble much
longer than most men, has also saved him from this
last and worst step of all; for, in his ignorance, he
took too large a dose of laudanum, and the effect has
mercifully been injurious instead of fatal. He is
now&mdash;"</p>
</div>

<p>Katharine read no more. Nothing further
could be of importance after she had learnt so
much. Ted had tried to destroy himself, and
it was on her account.</p>

<p>"Whatever is the matter, Katharine? I
have asked you the same question three times,"
Miss Esther was saying crossly. Katharine
stared at her in reply, with large, terrified eyes.
Her aunt repeated her question, and tried to
possess herself of the letter. Katharine came
to herself with a start, and snatched it back
again, and thrust it into her father's hand.</p>

<p>"Read it, daddy," she tried to say, but no
sound came; she seemed possessed of a great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
horror that robbed her of every faculty. The
Rector smoothed out the letter silently, glanced
at the florid signature, "Barrington Montague,"
and began to read it without waiting to put on
his glasses. Miss Esther looked from one to
the other, and was divided between her curiosity
and her annoyance.</p>

<p>"Really, Katharine, you are quite devoid of
manners. Am I not to have the right to ask a
simple question in my own house? Who is
the letter from, and what is it all about?"</p>

<p>Dorcas lingered by the door as long as she
dared, under pretence of being wanted; but
Miss Esther, who never relaxed her vigilance
even in a crisis, detected the subterfuge and
ordered her sharply out of the room. The
accustomed tone of reproof helped Katharine
to recover herself. She drew a deep breath,
and made an effort to speak.</p>

<p>"Ted is dying," she said. "They are afraid
to tell me, but I know it is so. And it is I
who have killed him, <i>I</i>! I am going to him
at once."</p>

<p>The Rector was blinking his eyes as he finished
reading the letter. Miss Esther held out
her hand again.</p>

<p>"I insist upon your giving me that letter,
Cyril," she said in her discordant voice.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
Katharine struck down her hand fiercely. Her
numbness was giving way to a kind of passionate
frenzy.</p>

<p>"Leave it alone, Aunt Esther!" she cried
vehemently. "It is no business of yours; you
don't understand; nobody understands. I have
made Ted take his life. I am going to him
<i>now</i>."</p>

<p>The last sentence was the only one that
reached Miss Esther's comprehension; she at
once took up her usual attitude of disapproval.</p>

<p>"Indeed, Katharine, you will do nothing of
the kind," she exclaimed querulously. "What
are we coming to next, I wonder? I sincerely
trust, Cyril, that you will point out to your
daughter that it is quite impossible for her to
visit a young man in his chambers. I really
wish that tiresome young Edward would emigrate,
or marry, or do something that would
put him out of the way. What has he been
doing now, I wonder?"</p>

<p>Katharine paid no heed; her eyes were fixed
feverishly on her father's face.</p>

<p>"Ted is ill, and he wants me. You will
let me go, daddy, won't you?" she said
imploringly.</p>

<p>"I beg you to assert your authority, Cyril,
by forbidding such a mad piece of folly," cried
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
the shrill tones of Miss Esther. Katharine
turned upon her furiously.</p>

<p>"<i>You</i>, what can <i>you</i> know about it? You
have never known what it is to want to protect
some one; you don't know the awful emptiness
of having no one to care for. Daddy!
you understand, don't you? I may go,
mayn't I?"</p>

<p>The Rector glanced from one to the other.
He had not put on his glasses, but he did not
seem to want them just then. Slowly the
tyranny of twenty years was losing its terrors
for him; he even forgot to laugh nervously as
the two women stood awaiting his answer; and
although there was a smile on his face as he
looked at them, it had only been called there
by a reflection on his folly in the past. He
marvelled at himself, as his eyes rested on the
glowing features of his daughter, for ever having
hesitated to support her.</p>

<p>"The child is in the right, Esther," he said,
mildly. "I&mdash;I am fond of the dear boy
myself, and he must not be left in the hour of
his need. We will go together, eh, Kitty?"</p>

<p>Miss Esther stared at him dumbly. She
had never heard him speak like that before.
After all, nothing is so convincing as the
sudden assumption of power by the oppressed;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
and few things are more complete than the
humiliation of the oppressor.</p>

<p>"Let me see," continued the Rector: "we
cannot catch anything before the 1.28. That
will give us time for an early lunch, if you will
kindly see to it, Esther. Kitty, my child, do
not fret over the boy; we will soon put him
to rights, eh?"</p>

<p>Katharine remained immovable, with Monty's
letter crunched in her hand. "Ted has tried
to kill himself&mdash;for <i>me</i>," were the words that
ran remorselessly in her mind.</p>

<p>Cyril Austen walked out of the room with
a firm step. Miss Esther rattled her keys,
muttered something to herself, and followed
him almost immediately.</p>

<p>She was dethroned at last.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<p>The landlady had gone out of the room and
closed the door. Katharine stepped softly to
the side of the bed, and looked at the sleeping
face. It was just the same as she had always
known it, rounded and beardless, without a
line or a wrinkle, and with the hair as loose and
rumpled as it had been in the days before
manhood had claimed its submission. "Dear
old Ted," she murmured to herself with a
half smile, "I don't believe he <i>could</i> look ill,
however much he tried." She stole about the
room, putting flowers in the vases, and lightening
some of its London dinginess, until the
sound of her name brought her back again to
the bedside.</p>

<p>"Dear old man, don't look so scared," she
laughed. "We heard you were ill, and we
came up to look after you, daddy and I.
Daddy is still downstairs; he discovered an
old print in the hall, and he hasn't got any
further yet. There are a lot of old prints in
the hall, so I suppose it will be ever so long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
before he does get any further. Isn't it like
daddy?"</p>

<p>She smoothed his hair gently, and he laughed
contentedly in reply. He did not seem at all
surprised to see her; Kitty always had turned
up, all his life, when he had got himself into a
scrape; and it did not occur to him at the
moment that she was more or less answerable
for his present scrape.</p>

<p>"Just see how hit up I am!" he said. "So
poor, isn't it?"</p>

<p>Her face clouded.</p>

<p>"Oh, Ted, how could you do it? Ought I
to have stayed in London and looked after
you?" she said reproachfully; and he saw
that it was useless to try to conceal anything
from her.</p>

<p>"It's all right, Kit," he hastened to explain in
his humble manner. "Don't swear, old chum!
I couldn't help it, on my honour I couldn't.
I got so sick, and I just had to. And after
all I played so poorly, you see, that it didn't
come off."</p>

<p>Except for the subject of their conversation,
they might have been back again in the lanes
at Ivingdon. They had dropped naturally
into their old boy and girl attitude, and hers
was as before the stronger personality. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
there was a subtle difference in their relations
which she was the first to feel.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I am glad it didn't come off, Ted,"
she said, trying to speak lightly. Ted gripped
her hand for a moment, and then let it go
again, as though he were half ashamed of his
momentary show of sentiment.</p>

<p>"You see," he went on, in a very gruff
voice, "that was the only part I left to
Providence, and Providence muffed it. I'm
such a rotten ass,&mdash;&nbsp;I always was, don't you
know? If it had been you, now, you wouldn't
have bungled it at all, would you?"</p>

<p>"Providence never has any sense of humour,"
said Katharine; and she got up hurriedly, so
that he should not see her face. She poured
out some medicine, and brought it to him.</p>

<p>"I say, it's awfully ripping to have you to
look after me like this," he observed. "What
did Miss Esther say?"</p>

<p>"She seemed upset," said Katharine, smiling
slightly. "But you can always square
Aunt Esther, when it's a question of illness;
there are such a lot of texts in the Bible about
illness, don't you know? By the way, when
did you last have something to eat?"</p>

<p>Ted had no idea, beyond a vague notion
that some one had brought him something on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
a tray in the morning, which he had not
looked at. So she left him to interview the
landlady, whom she found in the middle of a
long history of the print in the hall and of
the part it had played in the history of her
own family as well, to which the Rector was
listening patiently though with obvious inattention.
Katharine managed to procure what
she wanted, and returned with it to the sick
room. The invalid was looking more flourishing
than ever.</p>

<p>"You see," he explained, between the spoonfuls
with which she fed him, "he's such an
awfully snide doctor. He won't let me get
up, and of course, I'm as right as rain, really.
So cheap of him, isn't it?"</p>

<p>In spite of his assertion, however, he was
very glad to play the invalid when she
brought him some warm water, and proceeded
to bathe his hands and face. It was pleasant,
after the desolation of his life for the past six
months, to lie back in a lazy attitude without
feeling particularly ill, and allow the girl he
liked best in the world to do things for him.</p>

<p>"It's so rum," he remarked, "that our
hands never wear out with being washed so
often. I can't think why they don't want
soling and heeling after a time, like boots."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span></p>

<p>"I think you are right, and that your doctor
<i>is</i> rather 'snide,'" was all Katharine said, as
she carried away the basin, and looked for his
hair brushes. Ted's toilet table was characterised
by a luxurious confusion, and she
lingered for a moment to arrange the silver-topped
bottles in some kind of order. "You
never used to care for this sort of thing," she
remarked, holding up a bottle of <i>eau de toilette</i>;
"I remember how you teased me once, when I
told you I put lavender water in my cold bath."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, of course it's beastly rot and
all that," owned Ted; "but it's the thing
to do, and one must, don't you know?
Hullo, what are you playing at now?"</p>

<p>"I wish you would not be quite so languid,"
retorted Katharine. "How am I to
brush your hair if you persist in behaving as
though you were dying? I believe you are
putting it on."</p>

<p>"It's not my fault if I'm not so beastly
energetic as you," grumbled Ted. "Don't
play about any more, Kit; come over here
and talk. And you needn't fold up those
towels; they're not used to it, really."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't think they were, from the
look of them. Well, what have I got to talk
about?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span></p>

<p>She came and sat down on the chair by his
side, and he shifted his position so that he
could see her face. She could have laughed
aloud at his expression of utter contentment.</p>

<p>"Oh, some rot; anything you like. You've
always got lots to gas about, haven't you?
How is Ivingdon, and the Grange; and does
Peter Bunce still come in on Sunday afternoons;
and has the doctor got any new dogs?
Fire ahead, Kit! you've been down there
doing nothing all this time, and you must
know all there is to know, unless you're as
half alive as you used to be. Hasn't anything
happened to the old place?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Katharine, smiling back at him
frankly. "They have mended the gap in the
hedge."</p>

<p>"The devil they have!" cried Ted. "We'll
have it broken open again at once, won't we?
Why didn't you stop them? You knew I
wasn't there to tell them myself. Just like
their confounded impertinence!"</p>

<p>"Hush," interrupted Katharine. "You
mustn't get excited, old man; it isn't good
for you."</p>

<p>She smoothed his pillows and arranged his
coverlet with nervous rapidity, and Ted, submitting
happily to her services, wondered innocently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
what she was blushing about. But
he did not trouble himself to find out.</p>

<p>"I am beastly glad I poisoned myself," he
murmured, with lazy satisfaction.</p>

<p>She was glad of the diversion when the
Rector arrived at last, and she was allowed to
escape into the next room.</p>

<p>"Well, my boy, and how has the world
gone with you?" she heard her father say in
his genial tones.</p>

<p>"It's a beastly jolly world, and I'm the
jolliest brute in it," was Ted's reply.</p>

<p>They took rooms in the next street, and
came in every day to look after him; and
when neither the conscience of the "snide"
doctor, nor the desire of the invalid to be
nursed proved sufficient to preserve the farce
of his illness any longer, they still lingered
on under pretence of being wanted, and sent
carefully worded letters to Miss Esther from
which she was forced to conclude that their
presence in town was urgently required, much
as they would have wished it otherwise. What
really happened was, that Ted and Katharine
regularly conducted the old Rector to the British
Museum every morning, and passed the
day alone together until it was time to fetch
him away again in the afternoon. And in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
the evenings they initiated him into the joys
of a music hall, or introduced him to a new
comedian; and the Rector was happier than
he had ever been since the well-remembered
days in Paris. As for Katharine, her feelings
defied her own powers of description; she only
knew that she had the sensation of waking up
from a long, bad dream. Perhaps Ted felt
the same. "You've cured the biggest hump
I ever had in my life," was the way he expressed
it.</p>

<p>Looking back on the even tenor of those
few weeks, afterwards, Katharine was at a loss
to remember what she had talked about to
Ted in the many hours they had spent together.
Perhaps they had not talked at all;
at the time it never seemed to matter whether
they did or not; at all events, their conversation
usually lacked the personal element that
alone makes conversation distinctive. There
was nothing surprising to Katharine in this:
as long as she could remember Ted had been
the one person in the world to whom it was
impossible to talk about one's self; and his
sympathy for her was as completely superficial
as her love for him was mainly protective.</p>

<p>Once or twice she was led inadvertently into
making a confidant of him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span></p>

<p>"I wonder why I never seem to feel things
acutely now," she said to him one day as
they were strolling along the Embankment.
"I don't seem to care a bit what happens next,
except that I have a sort of conviction it is
going to be pleasant. I seem to want waking
up again. Do you know what I mean,
Ted?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's nothing; you're feeling played,
that's all," answered Ted, reassuringly. "My
experience is that you're either played, or
you're not played; and when you are, you'd
better have a drink to buck you up. We'll
have a cab, and lunch somewhere. Where
shall we go to-day?"</p>

<p>And Katharine laughed at his practical view
of things, and wondered why she had expected
him to understand. Another time, it was Ted
himself who gave the conversation a personal
turn.</p>

<p>"Humps are deuced odd things," he observed,
rather suddenly. It was a dull, warm
afternoon in December, and they had been
sitting idly for some minutes on one of the
benches in the park, overlooking the Serpentine.
"You feel that everything is awfully
decent, and bills be hanged, and all that; and
you curse your tailor and have a good time,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
and it doesn't matter if it snows. And then,
when it's rather a bore to be under an obligation
to a rotten little tradesman, or you
want a new coat or something, and you pay
up and feel awfully virtuous and don't owe a
blessed halfpenny in the world, except for
shirts and things that never expect to be paid
for,&mdash;<i>then</i>, you go and get the very deuce of
a hump."</p>

<p>"Whole books might be written on the
psychological aspect of the hump," murmured
Katharine.</p>

<p>"Look at those bounders, now," said Ted,
who had not heard her. "It doesn't matter
to <i>them</i> that rowing on the Serpentine on
Saturday afternoon isn't the thing to do, especially
in frock coats and bowlers. It makes
one quite sorry for them, to see how little
they know; they don't even know they are
bounders, poor devils! But <i>they</i> never get
the hump, confound them!"</p>

<p>"All the same," said Katharine, "it is a big
price to pay for an immunity from humps,
isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Life must be awfully easy, if you're a
bounder," continued Ted. "You haven't
got to be in good form, and you can walk
about with any sort of girl you please, and you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
needn't worry about the shape of your hat,
and it doesn't matter if you are seen on a
green Brixton 'bus. It saves so much thinking,
doesn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Katharine. "But you have to
be a bounder all the same, and you know you
can't even contemplate such a possibility, or
impossibility, without shuddering. By the
way, is all this intended to convey that you
have got the hump this afternoon?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said Ted, with restored cheerfulness.
"I ought never to have been born, of
course; but that's quite another matter."</p>

<p>Late that evening the Rector proposed returning
to Ivingdon. They had just been
to the theatre, and Ted had asked them in
to supper afterwards. Every trace of his
mood of that afternoon had disappeared, and
he was wrangling with Katharine over the
strength of the Rector's toddy with all the
energy of which his languid nature was capable.
Katharine put down the tumbler she
was holding and looked swiftly round at her
father.</p>

<p>"Oh, daddy, not yet!" she cried impetuously.
"I am happy now; don't let us spoil it all
by going home. I feel as though something
horrible would happen if we went home now.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
Can't we wait a little longer? I have never
been happy like this before."</p>

<p>The Rector murmured something about its
being three weeks to Christmas, but his sense
of duty was obviously a perfunctory one, and
he soon found he was not being listened to.
And Ted's hand closed over her fingers as he
took the hot glass from her, and his face
shone with pleasure and his voice trembled,
as he whispered, "Thank you for that, dear."</p>

<p>She did not shrink from him as she had
done once before when he had looked at her
with that same eager expression in his eyes.</p>

<p>"I don't know a bit whether I love him in
the real way," she told her mirror that night.
"I don't know anything about myself at all.
I believe the prig is inborn in me, after all, and
that it would suit me far better to fight for a
living in the world, than to stay at home and
just make Ted happy. But all the same, if he
asks me again I shall marry him. It has
been so peaceful lately, and I have felt so
happy, and marriage with Ted will mean peace
if it doesn't mean anything more thrilling than
that. Dear old Ted; why isn't he my
brother, or my son, or some one I could
just mother, and go on living my own life the
while? Ah, well, he is going to be my husband;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
how strange it sounds! I wonder if
women like me are ever allowed to be happy
in their own way, gloriously and completely
happy as I know I could be? But I suppose
it is only the prig in me that thinks so. And
Ted shall never know that I want more than
he can possibly give me. Oh, Ted, old chum,
I do love you so for loving me!"</p>

<p>A visit to Queen's Crescent slightly unsettled
her. She took her father with her and
introduced him to Phyllis Hyam, and tried to
convince herself that she was glad she was not
coming back any more; but in spite of the
unfamiliarity of being there as a visitor, and
the difficulty of finding topics of conversation
for the Rector and Miss Jennings, who obviously
misunderstood each other's attempts
to be friendly, the sight of the dingy little hall
and of Phyllis's round, good-humoured face,
brought enough reminiscences to her mind to
make her a little regretful as well.</p>

<p>"Do you still have bread and treacle, and
is Polly Newland glad I have gone, and does
any one ever talk about me?" she asked with
interest. Even Phyllis looked strange, as
though her best dress had been thrown on
hurriedly and the distinction of being admitted
to "Jenny's" room were rather too much for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
her; but there was a familiarity about her style
of conversation that was consoling.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," she replied in her off-hand way;
"when we have a new one put into our room
we always remember how blue you looked the
first night you came. We haven't had a 'permanent'
in our room since you left; and
there have been some cheerful specimens, too!
One was a nurse, who made the place smell
eternally of disinfectants; and another kept
bits of food in her drawer, and encouraged
mice; and a third insisted on having the window
shut. The curtains haven't been washed,
either, since you made that row about them.
I say, when are you coming back again?"</p>

<p>"You don't offer much inducement," laughed
Katharine. "But I am not coming back, in
any case."</p>

<p>"Going to get married?" asked Phyllis
sharply. Katharine smiled, and did not contradict
her. It was not an insinuation that one
would be anxious to contradict in a place like
Queen's Crescent, however diffident one might
feel about it elsewhere. Phyllis shrugged her
shoulders. "Well, don't go and make a hash
of it," she said. "You're not the sort to be
happy with any one, especially if it's made
too easy for you. Well off? Of course; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>
worships the ground you tread on, I suppose!
Oh, well, it's none of my business, and I only
hope you haven't made a mistake. It's a
risky thing at the best; and you were very
happy here most of the time, and you've got
to better that, you know. I wish you luck,
I'm sure, but it takes a woman to understand
any one like you, and I should like to see the
man who thinks he does it as well."</p>

<p>"I hope you will some day," said Katharine,
politely. But Phyllis did not respond with
any warmth, and Katharine was glad to return
to the masculine indifference of Ted. It was
difficult to worry about the future in Ted's
company; even the fact that he had not yet
formally proposed to her did not seem to cause
him any anxiety. It certainly made no difference
in the freedom of their intercourse; and,
as long as there was no immediate necessity
for action, Ted was not the one to take the
initiative. "I believe I shall have to propose
to him myself," was the thought that sometimes
crossed her mind as she studied his
placid, good-looking face. But after her visit
to Queen's Crescent, she began to wish he
would not be quite so casual about it; for,
without allowing even to herself that Phyllis's
want of encouragement had in any way affected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>
her decision, she had a lingering feeling that
the present state of things could not go on for
ever, and that it would be better for her, at all
events, to have the matter definitely settled.
So she made a kind of attempt, a day or two
later, to rouse his apprehensions.</p>

<p>"Phyllis was wondering if I was ever coming
back again to my work," she said to him
abruptly.</p>

<p>"Oh, was she? Rather a nice girl, Phyllis,
if she didn't dress so badly," observed Ted
unconsciously. They were at a Wagner concert
in the Queen's Hall, and the Siegfried
Idyll had just drawn to a close. It seemed to
her an auspicious moment.</p>

<p>"I said I was never coming back," pursued
Katharine, studying his profile critically.</p>

<p>"Of course not," said Ted, humming the
refrain they had just heard.</p>

<p>For once, Katharine felt faintly annoyed
with him for his want of proper sentiment.</p>

<p>"I don't believe you care whether I do or
not," she said in a piqued tone.</p>

<p>"Eh, what?" said Ted, staring round at her
in blank amazement. "Ought I to have said
anything else? But you settled that long ago,
Kit, didn't you? There is nothing more to
be said about it, is there?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, no, of course not," said Katharine, in
what seemed to him a most unreasonable manner;
"but all the same, I'm not at all sure
that I sha'n't go back when the term begins
again."</p>

<p>Ted stared more than ever.</p>

<p>"Oh, rats!" he exclaimed, heartily. "What's
wrong, Kitty? Have you been hit up to-day,
or anything? I'm such a rotten ass, I never
know. Of course you're never going to grind
any more; what an idea!"</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked Katharine, with uncomfortable
persistence. Ted began to make fresh
assertions, but paused in the middle and hesitated.
He suddenly realised that there was
only one answer to her question, and that he
would have to make it now. He looked
down and made havoc with his programme,
and stammered hopelessly until Katharine
took pity on him and came to his assistance
with a laugh.</p>

<p>"It's all right, old man; I am never going
back, of course," she said; and Ted brightened
up again when he found that he need not propose
to her yet, and was obviously relieved at
the establishment of their old relations. She
did nothing more to change them, and the only
result of her abortive attempt was, that Ted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
was more attentive to her than before, and constantly
made little plans for taking her to some
unfrequented museum or picture gallery, evidently
with some design in his mind which he
had not the courage to carry out.</p>

<p>"Poor old Ted," she thought to herself,
after they had spent a dull and silent afternoon
at the Royal Institute among the colonial produce;
"I wonder if he will ever get it out!"</p>

<p>Curiously enough, through all the weeks she
spent in town, the thought of Paul Wilton
rarely crossed her mind; and when it did she
felt that it referred to some former life of hers,
with which this present calm existence had no
connection. Sometimes she wondered idly
whether he were married yet, and if so, whether
he ever gave a thought to her; but she could
think of Marion as his wife without a regret,
and she was glad to find that she had no
desire whatever to see him again. The impression
he seemed to have left in her mind,
after all these months, was that of a disturbing
element which had brought the greatest unhappiness
into her life she had ever been forced
to endure. It was inconsequent, perhaps, that,
thinking thus, she should have been emphatic
in her refusal to go and see the Keeleys; but
although she was incapable of explaining why
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
she felt so strongly about such a small matter,
she was at least genuine in her belief that he
had no further place in her thoughts.</p>

<p>And then, two days before they left town,
she met him at last.</p>

<p>It was in Bury Street, late on a foggy afternoon,
as she was on her way to the Museum
with Ted. She had stopped with an exclamation
of delight in front of an old book shop,
and the owner, who was talking to an intending
purchaser inside, came out good-naturedly and
offered to light the gas jet over the tray of
dusty volumes. "I shall have to stop now,"
whispered Katharine; "supposing you go on
for daddy and bring him back here?"</p>

<p>The light flared up, and made a bright semicircle
in the gloom that was fast closing up
round the shop. The customer who was inside
concluded his purchase, and came out just
as Ted was strolling off. Apparently they did
not see each other, and the fog soon swallowed
up the retreating form; but Katharine turned
round at this moment from the book she was
examining, and met the stranger face to face.</p>

<p>"Ah," he said, quietly; "at last!"</p>

<p>"Yes," she repeated; "at last!"</p>

<p>It did not strike her until afterwards that
it was not at all the mode of address with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>
which she would have greeted him had she
been more prepared; but at the time it came
quite naturally to her lips. He still held her
hand as he went on speaking.</p>

<p>"And Ted? Where have you sent him?
Will he be long?"</p>

<p>She resented the implication in his words.</p>

<p>"I have not sent him anywhere. He has
gone to fetch my father from the Museum;
they will be back directly. Do you mean to
say you recognised Ted in that instant?"</p>

<p>"Why, surely! Did you not recognise me,
although I was standing back there in the
shadow?"</p>

<p>"Of course I didn't," cried Katharine hotly,
as she pulled away her hand. "I never saw
you until you came out into the light. I
should have stopped Ted if I had."</p>

<p>"Oh, to be sure; pardon my mistake. Of
course you would have detained Ted in that
case." And he smiled as though he were
faintly amused at something.</p>

<p>She had noticed his glad look of recognition,
and she hated him for it. What right had he
to be glad to see her? And now that he was
laughing at her and making insinuations about
Ted, true insinuations moreover, she hated him
still more for his acuteness.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span></p>

<p>"So you are back in town?" he was saying,
with what appeared to be meant for a kindly
interest. "I am not surprised, though. I
always knew you would have to come back."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" she asked, feeling
more annoyed than ever. It was so like him
to know everything about her without being
told, and then to put a complexion upon it
that he gave her no opportunity of contradicting.
"We came up, daddy and I, because
Ted was ill; and we are going back again on
Wednesday."</p>

<p>"Really? My mistake again. It is difficult
to imagine Ted except in the complete
enjoyment of his health. Not seriously ill, I
hope?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," she said, with an uncomfortable
conviction that she was being made to expose
herself in all her weakness; "but there was
no one to nurse him, so I came. He is all
right now."</p>

<p>"So I should judge from the brief glimpse
I had of him just now. Lucky fellow, Ted!
He looked very jolly, I thought; no doubt he
has good cause for his happiness. You are
looking well too, if I may say so. It is very
delightful to be young, is it not?"</p>

<p>She felt a wild rage against him for detecting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span>
the situation so absolutely, and for making it
merely a subject for his raillery. She did not
know how she would have wished him to take
it, but she hated him all the same for so
calmly accepting it.</p>

<p>"I don't understand you," she said, speaking
rapidly. "It isn't a bit delightful; you
know it isn't. You know I hate you; you
know I am the most miserable person in the
whole world. You know everything there is
to know about me; and I hate you! Why
did you come back to spoil it all, when I was
trying so hard to be happy?"</p>

<p>Her own words amazed her. She knew
they were true as she spoke them; but she
had not known it ten minutes ago.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," he said, gravely. "Shall I
go?"</p>

<p>He had completely dropped his jesting tone,
but she hated him for his pity even more than
she had hated him for his ridicule; she tried
to speak, but her anger choked her utterance.</p>

<p>"When will you be at Ivingdon again?" he
asked. "Did you say Wednesday? And you
are going to leave Ted in town?"</p>

<p>She asked herself why he did not go, instead
of standing there and making conversation by
inventing questions to which he could not possibly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span>
want to know the answers. But she
mechanically made a gesture in the affirmative
to both of them; and he repeated his former
inquiry with gentle insistence.</p>

<p>"Shall I go now?"</p>

<p>"Yes, go!" she cried fiercely, and ignored
the hand he proffered her, and let him go without
another word.</p>

<p>The fog swallowed him up, and she stood
and gazed at the place where he had stood, and
wondered vaguely if he had been there at all
or if she had not dreamt the whole incident.
For one moment the wild impulse seized her
to rush after him into the fog and the darkness,
and to implore him to take her with him anywhere,
so long as she might be with him. And
then a smile flickered across her face as the
bookseller came out and spoke to her; and she
paid for the first volume she picked up; and
the Rector and Ted emerged from the fog into
the semicircle of light, and life resumed its
ordinary aspect again.</p>

<p>"Has he gone?" asked Ted.</p>

<p>"Who? Mr. Wilton? I did not know
you saw him. Oh, yes; he went some time
ago. Isn't this a jolly little thing I have
picked up?" said Katharine lightly; and Ted
apparently thought no more about it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span></p>

<p>That evening she was almost feverishly gay.
The Rector sat and smiled happily as she
turned everything that occurred into ridicule,
and made every passer-by a subject for her wit.
They did not go to a theatre, on account of
the bad weather; and when Monty dropped
in to coffee later on, she kept him in a perpetual
condition of adoring approval until the
fact of Ted's gloomy silence was gradually
forced upon her, and she blamed herself hotly
for her stupidity. She was very cool to
Monty after she had realised her blunder;
and the poor fellow, who was quite ignorant
of his offence, took the first opportunity to
depart. Even then, in spite of her efforts to
be kind to him, Ted did not wholly recover
his spirits; and she sighed inwardly as she
reflected that she could not even be sure of
accomplishing the one task she had set herself
to perform.</p>

<p>And the next day her old restlessness possessed
her again. All the work of the past
six weeks seemed to have been suddenly undone;
nothing brought her any happiness, she
reflected bitterly; she was incapable of happiness
and it was absurd of her to have expected
to find it. All the same, perhaps if Ted were
to say something to her&mdash;but Ted still said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span>
nothing, and went about making plans for her
enjoyment on this her last day in town, as
though their coming separation were of no
matter at all; and he seemed as unconscious
of her change of mood as he had been all
along of her unusual contentment. The day
was not a success; their little improvised
amusements had been far more satisfactory
than the carefully planned ones of to-day, and
Ted's silence on the one subject of interest
grew more marked as the time wore on, and
ended in raising an uncomfortable barrier between
them. Once she felt sure that he would
have spoken if the Rector had not come in unexpectedly;
and once, he startled her by suddenly
taking both her hands in his and looking
into her eyes for a full minute, while she
waited passively for him to speak. But he
turned very red instead, and called himself a
fool and hurried out of the room, and left her
half amused and half regretful. She felt very
tender towards him after that; and the old
desire to mother him was very strong within
her when they stood together at last on the
platform at Euston, and had only a few moments
left in which to say what was in their
minds.</p>

<p>"God bless you, dear! I shall see you again
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>
soon?" was all she could bring herself to say
in that last moment.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;yes&mdash;perhaps. I am going to write
to you quite soon. I'm a rotten ass, as you
know, but&mdash;you will try and understand, won't
you, Kitty?"</p>

<p>The train went on, and she leaned out of
the window and laughed.</p>

<p>"I am sure I shall understand," she said.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<p>She waited in vain during the next two days
for Ted's letter. His parting words to her,
however, seemed to have again restored her
peace of mind; and the virtuous mood in
which she returned to Ivingdon was so unprecedented
as to rouse surprise rather than
the admiration it deserved. The climax was
reached when Miss Esther insisted on giving
her a tonic.</p>

<p>"It is very ridiculous," she remonstrated,
"that one is never allowed to drop one's characteristic
attitude for a moment. If I had
come home and behaved as childishly as I
usually do, you would have been quite satisfied;
but just because I am inclined to be
civilised for a change, you choose to resent it.
One would think you had taken out a patent
for all the virtues."</p>

<p>"My dear, that is doubtless very clever,
but I wish you would drink up this and not
keep me standing," returned her aunt, who
was, as ever, occupied with actions and not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>
with theories about them; and Katharine had
to seek consolation for her temporary discomfort
in the absurdity of the situation.</p>

<p>She wondered slightly why Ted had not
written to her at once, but after the vacillation
he had already shown she was not unprepared
for a further delay; it was more than
likely that he found the complexities of writing
what he could not speak to be greater
than he supposed, and it amused her to conjecture
that he would probably end in coming
to her for the help he had learnt to expect
from her in all the crises of his life. Meanwhile,
there was a whole lifetime before them in
which they could work out the effects of their
action, and in her present mood she saw no
satisfactory reason for hurrying it; she did not
realise how persistently she was recalling every
instance of Ted's kindness to her, as if to
strengthen her resolution, and she was unconscious
of the doggedness with which she
avoided dwelling on a certain episode in the
London visit which she had never even mentioned
to her father. She had cheated herself,
by degrees, into a complacency that she mistook
for resignation.</p>

<p>At last, by the mid-day post on Saturday
morning, she received her letter. It came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>
with another one, written in a hand that
brought association without distinct recollection
to her mind; and she opened the latter
first, principally because it was the one that
interested her least. The first page revealed
its identity; it was from Mrs. Downing, and
was characteristically full of underlined words
and barely legible interpolations, and she was
obliged to read it through twice before she
was able to grasp its meaning. The drift of
it was that the enterprising lady principal was
about to open a branch of her school in Paris,
where everything was to be French, "<i>quite</i>
French, you know, my dear Miss Austen,&mdash;staff,
conversation, cooking, games, <i>everything</i>;
a place to which I can send on the dear
children from here when they want finishing.
The French are such <i>delicious</i> people,
are they not? <i>So</i> unique, and <i>so</i> French!"
The morals, however, were to be English; so,
in spite of the unique French element in the
French character, there was to be an English
head to the establishment, and it was this
position that she proceeded in a maze of extravagant
compliments to offer to her former
junior mistress. "Not a duenna, of <i>course</i>,
for that will be supplied in the person of the
excellent Miss Smithson, who will act nominally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span>
as housekeeper, and make an <i>exquisite</i>
background to the whole. There are always
some of those dear foolish mammas who will
insist on placing propriety before education,&mdash;so
benighted, is it not? But Miss Smithson
was intended by Nature, I am sure, to propitiate
that kind of mamma; while <i>you</i>, my dear
Miss Austen, I intend to be something more
than a background. I look to you to give a
<i>tone</i> to the school, to manage the working of
it all,&mdash;the amusements, the lectures, indeed,
the whole <i>régime</i>; to be responsible for the dear
children's happiness, and to see that they write
happy letters home every week,&mdash;to take <i>my</i>
place, in fact. I could tell you <i>all</i> in two
minutes, etc., etc."</p>

<p>Katharine laid down the letter with an involuntary
sigh; the position it offered was full
of attractions to her, and the salary would have
been more than she had ever hoped to demand.
"I wish she had asked me six weeks
ago," she said aloud, and then accused herself
fiercely of disloyalty and picked up Ted's
letter, and studied the boyish handwriting on
the envelope as though to give herself courage
to open it. She had wanted to be alone with
his letter, and had carefully watched her father
out of the house before shutting herself into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span>
the study; so the sound of a footstep on the
gravel path outside brought a frown to her
face, and she remained purposely with her
back to the window so that the intruder, whoever
he was, should see that she did not mean
to be disturbed. But the voice in which she
heard her name spoken through the open
window arrested her attention.</p>

<p>She dropped the unopened letter on the
table, and turned slowly round to face the
speaker. The strangeness of his coming, when
she had been obstinately putting him out of
her thoughts since last Monday, had a paralysing
effect upon her nerves; and Paul swung
himself over the low window seat, and reached
her side in time to save her from falling. She
recovered herself immediately, however, and
shrank back from his touch.</p>

<p>"I do not understand why you are here,"
she found herself saying with difficulty.</p>

<p>"That is what I have come to explain," he
replied. "I could hardly expect you to understand."</p>

<p>His tone was curiously gentle. It struck
her, as she looked at him again, that he was
very much altered. She had not noticed his
appearance much as he stood outside the
book shop, with the dark fog at his back; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span>
now, as the light from the window behind fell
full on his head she saw the fresh streaks of
white in the black hair, and the sight affected
her strangely. Perhaps, while she in her arrogance
had believed him to be living in an
ill-gotten contentment, he, too, had had something
to suffer.</p>

<p>"Won't you sit down?" she said, and took
a chair herself, and waited for him to begin.
The one idea in her mind was that he should
not suspect her of nervousness.</p>

<p>"You were kind enough, when we last met
in the summer," began Paul, "to congratulate
me on my engagement to your cousin. I am
going to ask you to extend your kindness now,
and to congratulate us both on being released
from that engagement."</p>

<p>Katharine looked wonderingly at him. But
there was nothing to be gathered from his face.
She smiled rather sadly.</p>

<p>"Poor Marion!" she said, softly. "Isn't
anybody to be allowed to remain happy?"</p>

<p>"You mistake me," he corrected her carefully.
"Your cousin took the initiative in
the matter; she is obviously the one to be
congratulated."</p>

<p>"And you?"</p>

<p>"I? Oh, I suppose I have only my own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>
ignorance to blame. If I had had more
knowledge of women, I should have known
better what was expected of me. As it
is, my engagement has proved a complete
failure."</p>

<p>There was a pause, till Katharine roused
herself to speak in a lifeless kind of voice
that did not seem to belong to her.</p>

<p>"I am sorry if it has made you unhappy,"
she said. Paul looked at her critically.</p>

<p>"Are you sure?" he asked, smiling.</p>

<p>Katharine folded and unfolded her hands
uneasily, and wished he would go away and
remove his disquieting presence from her life
for ever.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," she said. "One is always
sorry when people are unhappy, of course."</p>

<p>"Only that?" His voice had a touch of
disappointment in it, and she began to tremble
for her composure. He got up and walked
to the window and looked across the lawn,
where the wintry sun was struggling through
the bare branches of the elm trees and making
faint intricate patterns on the whitened grass
below. "This is where I first met you, three
years ago," he went on as though he were
talking to himself. "You were only a child
then, and you interested me. I used to wonder
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span>
what there was about you that interested
me so much, a mere child like you! You were
very sweet to me in those days, Katharine."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I wish you wouldn't," said Katharine.
But he did not seem to hear her.</p>

<p>"Most men would have behaved differently,
I suppose," he went on, still looking away
from her. "It is very fatal to admit the possibility,
even to ourselves, of making a new
system for an effete civilisation like ours; and
I was a fool to suppose that women could be
dealt with by any but the obvious methods.
It is my own fault, of course, that in my
anxiety to keep your respect I managed to
destroy your affection."</p>

<p>She wanted to vindicate herself, to protest
against what seemed to her his confident self-righteousness;
but the old influence was creeping
over her again, and it numbed her.</p>

<p>"I wish you would not say those things,"
she said, weakly. The unopened letter lying
on the red table-cloth seemed like a protest
against the futility of the scene that was passing,
and she found herself controlling a desire
to laugh at the mockery of it all.</p>

<p>He turned round again with a half-suppressed
sigh, and took out his watch.</p>

<p>"Just twelve," he said, reflectively. "I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span>
must be off if I mean to walk to the station.
You will forgive me for having worried you
with all this? I had a sort of feeling that I
should like to tell you about it myself; our
old friendship seemed to demand that little
amount of frankness, though I suppose you
will think I have no right to talk about
friendship any longer. I acknowledge that I
have given you every reason to be vexed with
me; if I can ever do anything to remove
the disagreeable impression from your mind,
I hope you will let me know. Good-bye."</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you are not going?" She had
risen too, and was standing between him and
the door. She did not know why she wished
to keep him, but she knew she could not let
him go.</p>

<p>"Unless you can show me a satisfactory
reason for remaining," was his reply. She was
trembling violently from head to foot.</p>

<p>"I cannot bear that you should leave me
like this," she said in a low voice.</p>

<p>"It rests with you to say whether I am to
go or not," said Paul in the same tone. She
was looking straight into his eyes; but what
she saw, for all that, was the unopened letter
on the red table-cloth. She put out her hands
as if to push him away from her, but he mistook
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">374</a></span>
her movement and grasped them both in
his own.</p>

<p>"Don't, oh, don't!" she cried, struggling
feebly to release herself. "I want you to go
away, please. I thought it was all over and
that I should never see you again, and I was
beginning to feel happy, just a little happy;
and now you have come back, and you want
it to begin all over again, and I can't let it,&mdash;I
am not strong enough! Oh, won't you go,
please?"</p>

<p>"If you send me, I will go," said Paul, and
waited for her answer. But none came, and
he laughed out triumphantly. She had never
heard him laugh so thoroughly before.</p>

<p>"I knew you couldn't, you proud little
person," he said, with a sudden tenderness in
his smile. "The woman in you is so strong,
is it not, Katharine? Ah, I know far more
about you than you know yourself; but you
don't believe that, do you? Shall I tell you
why I came to you to-day? It was just to say
to you that I could not live without you any
longer. Isn't that strange? I have been
brutally frank with you to-day, Katharine,
there is not another woman in the world who
would have taken it as you have done. I
knew you would, before I came to you; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">375</a></span>
the knowledge gives me courage to tell you
one thing more. You know the failure of my
attempt to marry for ambition; will you, in
your sweetness, help me to marry for love?"</p>

<p>He dropped her hands and moved away
from her. The delicacy of his action, slight
though it was, appealed to her strongly. She
turned her back to the table to avoid seeing
the white letter on the red table-cloth.</p>

<p>"I cannot marry you," she said, hurriedly.
"I would have been your slave a few months
ago, but I cannot be your wife now."</p>

<p>Except for a tightening of his lips, he did
not move a feature.</p>

<p>"That is not true; I cannot believe it," he
said shortly.</p>

<p>"Why not?" she asked in a tired voice.
She hoped he would not guess how near she
was to submission.</p>

<p>"Because it is not possible. You are not
the kind of woman who changes. You must
love me now, because you loved me then.
You cannot deny that you loved me then?"</p>

<p>"No," said Katharine, "I cannot deny it."</p>

<p>"Then why do you pretend that you do
not love me still? I do not believe it is because
of my engagement to your cousin. You
are made of finer clay than others, and&mdash;"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">376</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, no; that is not the reason," she said,
interrupting him impatiently.</p>

<p>"Will you not tell me why it is?" he
asked, approaching her again. There was no
mistaking the tenderness in his tone now, and
she cast about in her mind for some excuse
to dismiss him before she completely lost her
power of resistance. "Have I made you so
angry that you will never forgive me?"</p>

<p>"No, no; you never made me angry," she
protested. "But you made me feel absurd,
and that is ever so much worse. I cannot be
sure, now, that you are not merely laughing
at me. Have you forgotten that you once
thought me a prig? I have not altered; I
am still a prig. How can you want to marry
me when you have that image of me in your
mind? It is hopeless to think of our marrying,&mdash;you
with a secret contempt for me, and
I with a perpetual fear of you!"</p>

<p>The man in him alone spoke when he answered
her.</p>

<p>"Surely, it is enough that we love each
other?"</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"Ah, you know it is not," she replied, with
the strange little smile that had so often baffled
him. "I&mdash;I do so wish you would understand&mdash;and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">377</a></span>
go. Or shall I find my
father and tell him that you are here?"</p>

<p>He laid his hand against her cheek, and
watched her closely.</p>

<p>"Is it all over,&mdash;our friendship, your love
for me, everything?" he whispered. "Do
you remember how sweetly you nursed me
three years ago? Have you forgotten the jolly
talks we had together in the Temple? And all
the fun we had together in London? Is it all
to come to an end like this?"</p>

<p>"I can't marry you; I don't love you
enough for that," she said, moving restively
under his touch. He stroked her cheek
gently.</p>

<p>"Then why do you thrill when I touch
you?" he asked. "Why do you not send
me away?" It was his last move, and he
watched its effect anxiously. She looked at
him helplessly.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I do send you away," she said faintly,
and he made her join feebly in the laugh
against herself. There was something contemptible
in her surrender, she felt, as he
folded her in his arms and looked down at
her with a manly air of possession.</p>

<p>"If this is not love what is it, you solemn
little Puritan?" he murmured.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">378</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know," said Katharine dully.
She submitted passively to his embrace, and
allowed him to kiss her more than once.</p>

<p>"Of course you don't know," he smiled.
"What a woman you are, and how I love you
for it! Don't be so serious, sweetheart; tell
me what you are thinking about so deeply?"</p>

<p>It was pity for him, her old genuine love
for him reawakening, that made her at last
rouse herself to tell him the truth.</p>

<p>"Will you please let me go, Paul?" she
asked submissively. And as he loosened his
arms and allowed her to go, she took one of
his hands and led him with feverish haste
round to the table, where Ted's letter still
lay like a silent witness against herself. They
stood side by side and looked at it, the white
envelope on the red table-cloth, and it was
quite a minute before the silence was broken.
Then Katharine pulled him away again and
covered up the letter with her hand and
looked up in his face.</p>

<p>"Do you know what is in that letter?" she
asked, and without waiting for a reply went on
almost immediately. "It is from Ted, to ask
me to be his wife."</p>

<p>"And you are going to say&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">379</a></span></p>

<p>Paul smiled incredulously.</p>

<p>"It is impossible," he said. "I decline to
believe what you say now, after what you said
to me on Monday afternoon."</p>

<p>"Ah," she cried, "I was mad then. You
always make me mad when I am with you.
You must not talk any more of Monday afternoon;
you must forget what I said to you
then, and what I have said to you to-day; you
must forget that I have allowed you to kiss
me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Forget?" interrupted Paul. "Are <i>you</i>
going to forget all this?"</p>

<p>She turned away with a little cry.</p>

<p>"You make it so hard for me, Paul; and it
seemed so easy before you came!"</p>

<p>"Then it doesn't seem so easy now?"</p>

<p>She evaded his question. "I know I am
right, because I thought it all out when you
were not here," she went on piteously. "I
cannot trust myself even to think properly
when you are there; you make me quite unlike
myself. That is why I am going to marry
Ted. Ted is the sanest person I know; he
leaves me my individuality; he doesn't paralyse
me as you do; and I am simply myself
when I am with him."</p>

<p>"Simply yourself!" echoed Paul. "My
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">380</a></span>
dear little girl, whatever in heaven or earth has
allowed such a misapprehension to creep into
your head?"</p>

<p>"I know what you mean," she said. "I
have thought that out, too. You know more
about me than anybody in the whole world;
Ted will never know as much as you know,
although I am going to be his wife. You are
the only person I could ever talk to about myself;
you are the only person who understands.
I know all that. But one does not want that
in a husband; one wants some one who will be
content with half of one's self, and allow the
other half to develop as it pleases. You would
never be content with less than the whole,
would you, Paul? Ah, that is why I loved
you so madly! It is so queer, isn't it, that
the very things that make us fall in love
are the very things that make marriage impossible?"</p>

<p>He did not speak, and she put her arms
round his neck impulsively and drew his head
down to hers.</p>

<p>"Don't you understand, dear?" she said.
"It is impossible to find everything we want
in one person, so we have to be content with
satisfying one side of ourselves, or accept the
alternative and not marry at all. Ted wants
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">381</a></span>
me badly, or I would rather choose not to
marry at all. But he must have some one to
look after him,&mdash;he can't live alone like some
men; and I have always looked after him all
my life. He has come in my way again now,
so I am going to look after him to the end. I
am very fond of Ted, and we have learnt to be
chums, so I don't think it will be a failure.
Oh, do say you understand, Paul?"</p>

<p>"Do you love him?" asked Paul.</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied.</p>

<p>"As you loved me?"</p>

<p>"No," said Katharine, simply. "I could
never love any one again like that. I wore
myself out, I think, in my love for you. Oh,
I know I am spoiled; I know I have only the
second best of myself to give to Ted; but if he
is content with that, ought I not to be glad to
give it?"</p>

<p>"But <i>you</i>, your own happiness," he urged
brokenly. "Have you no thought for your
own happiness?"</p>

<p>"Happiness?" she said, smiling again.
"Oh, I do not expect to find happiness.
Women like me, who ask for more than life
can possibly give them, have no right to expect
the same happiness as the people who
have found out that it is better to make a compromise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">382</a></span>
and to take what they can get! Oh,
I shall never be greatly happy, I know that.
But I do not mind much; it is enough for me
that I did once taste the real, glorious happiness,
if it was only in snatches."</p>

<p>"Won't you taste it again?" he said, drawing
her suddenly to him. "Won't you give
up this impossible scheme of yours, and come
to me? We will be married over there by
your father,&mdash;now,&mdash;this very day. We
will go abroad, travel, do what you will.
Only come with me, Katharine. You belong
to me, and to me only; you dare not deny it.
Come with me, Katharine."</p>

<p>"No," she said, shaking her head. "I am
not going to spoil your life, as you have spoilt
mine. You will be a great man, Paul, if you
do not marry me."</p>

<p>"Listen," he said, without heeding her.
"This is the last time I shall ask you; this
is the last time I shall hold you in my arms,&mdash;<i>so</i>.
I shall go away after this, and you will never
see me again, nor hear of me again. I shall
never kiss you any more, nor ask you to come
away with me, nor tell you I love you as I
never loved another woman. If you come to
me on your knees and beg me to love you
again, I will not relent. Do you understand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">383</a></span>
me? This is the last, the very last time. <i>Now</i>
what have you to say? Will you come with
me?"</p>

<p>She threw back her head and met his gaze
as he bent over her.</p>

<p>"No," she said again. He covered her face
with kisses.</p>

<p>"And now?"</p>

<p>"No," she repeated desperately; and she
crept away from him at last, and took her letter
from the table and tried to walk to the door.</p>

<p>A slippered footstep shuffled along the hall
and stopped outside the library door. The
next moment the Rector was in the room.</p>

<p>"Kitty, my child, have you seen my hat anywhere?
I feel convinced I put it down somewhere,
and for the life of me&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused as he saw Paul, and held out his
hand with a smile of welcome.</p>

<p>"Delighted to see you again, my dear sir,
delighted! That is to say," added the old
man, looking to Katharine for assistance, "I
suppose I <i>have</i> seen you before, though for the
moment I cannot quite recall your name. But
my memory is getting a bad one for names, a
very bad one, eh, Kitty? Anyhow, you will
stop to lunch, of course; and meanwhile, if I
can only find my hat&mdash;"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">384</a></span></p>

<p>"Daddy, it is Mr. Wilton," explained
Katharine, making an effort to speak in her
usual voice. Strange to say, it did not seem
difficult to become usual again now that her
father was in the room. "He stayed with us
once, a long time ago; you remember Mr.
Wilton, don't you?"</p>

<p>"To be sure, to be sure; of course I remember
Mr. Wilton perfectly!" said the Rector,
shaking hands with him again. "I can remember
distinctly many of our little talks on archæology
and so forth. Let me see, any relation
to the great numismatist? Ah, now I know
who you are quite well. There was an accident,
or a calamity of some sort, if I recollect
rightly. Kitty, my child, have you found my
hat?"</p>

<p>"Will you stay to lunch?" Katharine was
asking him.</p>

<p>"Of course he will stay to lunch," cried the
Rector, without giving him time to reply.
"I've picked up some fine specimens of old
Sheffield plate that I should like to show you,
Mr. Wilton. Stay to lunch? Why, of course.
Dear me, I know I saw it somewhere&mdash;&nbsp;Got
to catch the two-thirty? Oh, that's all right;
we'll drive you to the station after lunch.
That child will like a chat with you, eh, Kitty?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">385</a></span>
You used to be great friends, and she has something&mdash;no,
no, I've looked there twice&mdash;something
of interest to tell you, something of
very great interest, eh, Kitty? A nice young
fellow he is, too," continued the old man, stopping
for a moment in his fruitless search. "By
the way, you know him, don't you? It's
young&mdash;&nbsp;Ah, now I remember! I left it in
the vestry; so stupid of me!"</p>

<p>Paul stopped him as he was hurrying out of
the room.</p>

<p>"I must be off, thank you, sir. I am not
going to catch the two-thirty at all. I think I
will walk on somewhere and catch something
else, if there happens to be anything. I am
sure I wish Miss Katharine every happiness.
Good-morning."</p>

<p>He went out by the window as he had come,
and they watched him as he walked across the
lawn, the neat figure crowned by the conventional
felt hat. He had not shaken hands with
Katharine nor looked at her again.</p>

<p>The Rector glanced after him and smoothed
his hair thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Curious man that," he remarked with his
simple smile. "He always looks to me as
though there were a tragedy in his life."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't think so," said Katharine,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">386</a></span>
coldly. "It is only his manner. He takes a
joke tragically. Besides, he has never married
unhappily, or anything like that."</p>

<p>"That may be," said Cyril Austen, with one
of his occasional flashes of intuition; "but it
means a tragedy to some men if they haven't
got married at all, and I fancy that's one of
them. Ah, well, his father was one of our
best&mdash;"</p>

<p>Miss Esther's voice came shrilly down the
passage, and the Rector hastened out of the
room without finishing his sentence.</p>

<p>"The annoyances of life," thought Katharine
cynically, "are much more important than
the tragedies."</p>

<p>She picked up her letter once more and tore
it open. Even then she did not read it at
once, but looked out of the window first and
beyond the garden, where a man's felt hat was
moving irregularly along the top of the hedge.
She made an impatient gesture and turned her
back to the light, and unfolded Ted's letter at
last. And this is what it contained:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"By the time you get this, I shall have cleared out.
I may be an infernally rotten ass, but I won't let the
best girl in the world marry me out of kindness, and
that is all you were going to do. I tried to think you
were a little keen on me a few weeks ago, but of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">387</a></span>
course I was wrong. Don't mind me. I shall come
up smiling again after a bit. It was just like my
poorness to think I could ever marry any one so
clever and spry as yourself. Of course you will buck
up and marry some played-out literary chap, who will
gas about books and things all day and make you
happy. Good old Kit, it has been a mistake all along,
hasn't it? When I come back, we will be chums
again, won't we? I am off to Melbourne in the
morning and shall travel about for a year, I think.
You might write to me&mdash;the jolly sort of letters you
used to write. Monty knows all my movements.</p>

</div>

<p>The letter fell from her hand, and she turned
and gazed blankly out of the window. The
felt hat was no longer to be seen at the top of
the hedge.

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<p>High up in one of the houses on the shady
side of the Rue Ruhmhorff, Katharine sat on
her balcony and thought. Her reflections
were of the desultory order begotten of early
spring lethargy and early spring sunshine, relating
to street cries innumerable and to the
mingled scent of violets and asphalt in the
air, to the children playing their perpetual game
of hop-scotch on the white pavements, and to
the artisan opposite who was mixing his salad
by the open window with a naïve disregard for
the public gaze. Her pupils were all in the
Bois under the able supervision of the excellent
Miss Smithson, and there was temporary calm
in the three <i>étages</i> that formed Mrs. Downing's
Parisian establishment for the daughters
of gentlemen.</p>

<p>"Will he ever have done, I wonder?"
speculated Katharine lazily. She was taking
quite a languid interest in the progress of the
salad, and smiled to herself when the man took
off his blue blouse and attacked it afresh in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">389</a></span>
his shirt sleeves. His wife joined him after a
while, evidently, to judge from her emphatic
gestures, with critical intent. But the man received
her volley of suggestions with an expressive
shrug of the shoulders, and they finally
went off to their mid-day meal.</p>

<p>"What pitiable jargon we talk, all the world
over, about the triumph of mind over matter,"
murmured Katharine, yawning as she spoke.
"And all the while matter goes on triumphing
over mind on every conceivable occasion!
It even gets into the street cries," she added
with another yawn, as a flower vender came
along the street below and sent up his minor
refrain in unvarying repetition. "Des violettes
pour embaumer la chambre," he chanted, "du
cresson pour la santé du corps!"</p>

<p>It was more than a year since she had accepted
Mrs. Downing's offer and settled here
in Paris; more than a year since Ted had gone
abroad and Paul Wilton had bidden her farewell.
But she never looked back on those
days now, though not so much from design as
from lack of incentive; for her life had strayed
into another channel, and her days were full of
the kind of occupation that leaves no room
for the luxury of reminiscence. It never even
occurred to her to wonder whether she was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">390</a></span>
happy or not; she seemed to have completely
lost her old trick of wanting a reason for everything
she thought or felt, and for the time
being she had become eminently practical.
Even now, in spite of the enervating effect of
the first spring weather, her thoughts returned
to the business of the moment, and she wondered
why the father of her newest pupil, who
had made an appointment with her for eleven
o'clock, was so late in coming. A ring at the
electric bell seemed to answer her thought, and
the maid came in almost immediately with a
gentleman's card on a tray.</p>

<p>"British caution," was Katharine's criticism,
as Julie explained that the English monsieur
had not attempted to teach her his name. By
the merest chance she glanced at the card before
her visitor came in, and was spared the
annoyance of betraying the surprise she must
otherwise have felt. As it was, she had time
to recover from her astonishment, even to remark
how different the familiar name and address
seemed to her when, for the first time as
now, she saw them transcribed on a visiting
card,&mdash;"Mr. Paul Wilton, Essex Court,
Temple."</p>

<p>"I am so glad to see you," she exclaimed,
with a look that did not contradict the welcome
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">391</a></span>
in her voice. And Julie, who had never
seen her mistress look so joyous before, went
back to Marie in the kitchen with a highly
coloured account of the meeting she had just
witnessed, which explained to that frivolous
but astute little person how it was that
Madame always looked so leniently on her
flirtations with the <i>charcutier</i> round the corner.</p>

<p>"I have never caught you idling before,"
said Paul, referring to the attitude in which he
had seen her through the open door before
she had turned round with that glad look in
her eyes.</p>

<p>"I don't suppose you have," she said. "It
isn't so very long since I learnt how to idle.
Do you remember how bitterly you used to
complain because I never wanted to lounge?
I often lounge now; and my greatest joy is to
think about nothing at all. Don't you know
how restful it is to think about nothing at all?"</p>

<p>"You must have altered a good deal," he
observed.</p>

<p>"Do you think I have, then?"</p>

<p>"Ask me that presently," he replied, with
an answering smile. "I have got to hear all
the news first,&mdash;how keeping school agrees with
you, and everything there is to tell about yourself.
So make haste and begin, please."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">392</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, there is nothing to tell about myself;
at least, nothing more than you can learn
from the prospectus! Would you like to see
one? You can read it and learn what an important
person I am, while I go and leave a
message for Miss Smithson."</p>

<p>When she came back, he regarded her with
a look of amused interest.</p>

<p>"This is a very novel sensation," he remarked.</p>

<p>"I am glad it amuses you," said Katharine;
"but I never knew before that the prospectus
was funny."</p>

<p>"Oh, no; it isn't that," he explained. "The
humour of a prospectus is the kind of grim
joke that could only be expected to appeal to
a parent. What I meant was the fact of your
appearing to me for the first time in the character
of hostess."</p>

<p>"I wondered how it was that I did not feel so
awed by your presence as usual," she remarked.
"Now I know it is because you, even you, are
sensible to the chastening atmosphere of the
home of the young idea. You had better
come round the establishment at once, before
the favourable impression begins to wear off."</p>

<p>"Oh, please!" he implored. "You will
surely let me off? I haven't a daughter or a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">393</a></span>
niece, or any kind of feminine relation who
could be of the least commercial value to you.
And I really don't feel equal to facing crowds
of unsophisticated girls in short frocks, with
pocket editions of their favourite poets in their
hands. Girls of that age always expect you
to be so well informed, and I haven't run a
favourite poet for years."</p>

<p>"When you first met me," she said emphatically,
"<i>I</i> was an unsophisticated girl in a short
frock, with a whole list of favourite poets. And
I distinctly remember one occasion on which
I bored you for half an hour with my views on
Browning."</p>

<p>"I am not here to deny it," said Paul. "It
is only an additional reason for my wishing to
stay and talk to you, now that you have ceased
to have any views on any subject whatever.
Besides, I exhausted the subject of unsophistication
in short frocks when I first had the
pleasure of meeting you, four years ago. And,
interesting as I found it then, I have no particular
wish to renew it now."</p>

<p>"All of which is an unpleasant reflection on
the enormous age I seem to have acquired in
four years," she cried. "They must have been
singularly long years to you!"</p>

<p>"With the exception of the last one," said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">394</a></span>
Paul, "they were much the same as any other
years to me."</p>

<p>"Now, that's odd," she remarked; "because
last year has seemed to go more quickly
than any other year in my life. I wonder why
it seemed so long to you?"</p>

<p>"It didn't," he replied promptly. "It was
the other three that did that, because I spent
them in learning wisdom."</p>

<p>"And the last one in forgetting it? How
you must have wasted the other three! Ah,
there are the girls at last," she added, springing
to her feet. "That means déjeûner, and I am
as hungry as two wolves. You will stop of
course?"</p>

<p>"More developments," he murmured. "You
used to scorn such mundane matters as meals,
in the days when the poets were food enough
for you. But please don't imagine for a
moment that I am going to face that Anglo-French
crowd out there; I would almost as
soon listen to your opinion of Browning."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say," she complained,
"that you expect me to minister to your wants
in here? What will Miss Smithson say, what
will the dear children say in their weekly letters
home? You don't really mean it?"</p>

<p>"On the contrary," he replied, placidly, "I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">395</a></span>
am going to take you out to lunch in the
most improper restaurant this improper city
can produce. So go and put on that Parisian
hat of yours, and be as quick as you like
about it. I am rather hungry, too."</p>

<p>"You really seem to forget," she said, "that
I am the respectable head of a high-class
seminary for&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I only wish you would allow me to forget
it," he interrupted. "It is just because you
have been occupying yourself for a whole year,
and with the most lamentable success, in growing
elderly and respectable, that I intend to give
you this opportunity of being regenerated.
May I ask what you are waiting for, now?"</p>

<p>"I am waiting for some of the conventional
dogma you used to preach to me in the days
when <i>I</i> wanted to be improper," she retorted.
"It would really save a great deal of trouble
if our respective moral codes could be induced
to coincide sometimes, wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>"It would save a great deal of trouble if
you were to do as you are told, without talking
quite so much about it. It is now half-past&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I tell you it is impossible," she protested.
"You must have your déjeûner here, with unsophistication
twenty-five strong&mdash;and Miss
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">396</a></span>
Smithson. What is the use of my having
acquired a position of importance if I deliberately
throw it away again by behaving like
an improper schoolgirl?"</p>

<p>"What is the use of a position at all,"
replied Paul, "if it doesn't enable you to be
improper when you choose? Don't you think
we might consider the argument at an end?
I am quite willing to concede to Miss Smithson,
or to any other person in authority, that
you have made all the objections necessary
to the foolish possessor of a conscience, if you
will only go and tell her that you do not intend
to be in to lunch."</p>

<p>"I have told her," said Katharine inadvertently,
and then laughed frankly at her own
admission. "I always spoil all my deceptions
by being truthful again too soon," she added
plaintively.</p>

<p>"Women always spoil their vices by incompletion,"
observed Paul. "They have reduced
virtue to an art, but there is a crudity about
their vice that always gives them away sooner
or later. That is why they are so easily found
out; it is not because they are worse than
men, but because they are better. They repent
too soon, and your sins always find you
out when you begin to repent."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">397</a></span></p>

<p>"That's perfectly true," said Katharine,
half jestingly. "You would never have discovered
that I was a prig if I had not become
partly conscious of it first."</p>

<p>"That," said Paul deliberately, "is a personal
application of my remarks which I
should never have dreamed of making myself;
but, since you are good enough to
allow it, I must say that the way you have
bungled the only vice you possess is quite
singular. If you had been a man no one
would have detected your priggishness at all;
at its worst it would have been called personality.
It is the same with everything. When
a woman writes an improper book she funks
the crisis, and gets called immoral for her
pains; a man goes the whole hog, and we
call it art."</p>

<p>"According to that," objected Katharine,
"it is impossible to tell whether a man is
good or bad. In fact, the better he appears
to be the worse he must be in reality; because
it only means that he is cleverer at concealing
it."</p>

<p>"None of us are either good or bad," replied
Paul. "It is all a question of brains.
Goodness is only badness done well, and morality
is mostly goodness done badly. I should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">398</a></span>
like to know what I have said to make you
smile?"</p>

<p>"It isn't what you have said," laughed
Katharine; "it is the way you said it. There
is something so familiar in the way you are
inventing a whole new ethical system on the
spur of the moment, and delivering it just as
weightily as if you had been evolving it for
a lifetime. Do go on; it has such an additional
charm after one has had a holiday for
more than a year!"</p>

<p>"When you have done being brilliant and
realised the unimportance of being conscientious,
perhaps you will kindly go and get
ready," said Paul severely. And she laughed
again at nothing in particular, and raised no
further objection to following what was distinctly
her inclination.</p>

<p>When they had had déjeûner and were
strolling through the Palais Royal, he alluded
for the first time to their parting at Ivingdon
more than a year ago. She gave a little start
and reddened.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't let us talk about that; I am
so ashamed of myself whenever I think of
it," she said hastily.</p>

<p>"I am sorry," he replied with composure,
"because I particularly wish to talk about it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">399</a></span>
just now. You must remember that, until
I met Ted in town last week, I had no idea
you were not married."</p>

<p>She turned and stared at him suddenly.</p>

<p>"I never thought of that," she said, slowly.</p>

<p>"Of course you didn't. In fact, all your
proceedings immediately following that particular
day in December seem to have been
characterised by the same lack of reflection.
You might have known that there was no one
who could tell me of your erratic actions.
And how was I to guess that you would go
flying off to Paris just when everything was
made easy for you to stop in England? I was
naturally forced to conclude, as I neither saw
nor heard from you again, that you had carried
out your absurdly heroic purpose of marrying
Ted. I must say, Katharine, you have a
wonderful faculty for complicating matters."</p>

<p>"Nothing of the sort," she said indignantly.
"And your memory is no better than mine,
for you seem to forget that it was you who
made our parting final. You were so tragic
that of course I thought you meant it."</p>

<p>"Before we criticise my own action in the
matter," said Paul, "I should rather like to
know why you did come and bury yourself
here, without telling anybody?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">400</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, it is easy for you to smile and be
sarcastic! I had to come, of course; it was
the only thing to be done. Nature had made
me a prig, and everything was forcing me to
continue to be a prig, and all my attempts at
being anything else didn't come off. What
chance is there for any one with priggish tendencies
in a world like ours? It simply
bristles with opportunities for behaving in a
superior way, unless you resolutely make up
your mind to skim over the surface of it and
never to think deeply at all. What was I to
do? Ted had gone abroad to escape from my
overbearing superiority, and you had left in
disgust because marrying for love wasn't good
enough for me; and then I had Mrs. Downing's
letter, and she persisted in thinking that
I was the only person in the world who could
manage the mothers of her fashionable pupils.
It seemed as though I were destined to remain
a superior person to the end of my days, and I
wasn't going to fight against my natural tendencies
any longer. I determined that if I had
got to be a prig at all, I would at least make
as good a prig as possible. Now do you understand
why I came?"</p>

<p>"Before I attempt to do that, do you mind
mentioning where you are going to take me?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">401</a></span>
said Paul casually. She looked round quickly
and found that they had wandered down to
the Seine and were close to the landing-stage
of the boats that went to St. Cloud; and an
importunate proprietor was representing to
them in broken English the charms of a trip
down the river.</p>

<p>"Oh, let us go!" she cried impulsively.
"It would be so beautiful! Miss Smithson
will never respect me again, but I don't feel as
though I <i>could</i> go back to all those girls just
yet. Oh, don't be so musty! It <i>won't</i> be
chilly, and you are not a bit too old, and you
have just got to come. Oh, don't I remember
those moods of yours when everything was
too youthful for you! I never knew any one
with such a plastic age as yours."</p>

<p>He smiled perfunctorily, and gave in; and
they were soon journeying down the Seine.
Katharine was in a mood to appreciate everything,
and she leaned over the side of the boat
and made a running commentary on the beauty
of the scene as they glided along between the
banks. Paul tried two or three seats in succession,
and finally chose one with an air of
resignation and felt for his tobacco pouch.</p>

<p>"There is a smell of oil," he said. "And
the chestnuts at Bushey are far finer."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">402</a></span></p>

<p>"Can't you lower your standard just for
this one afternoon?" she suggested mockingly.
"It would be so pleasant if you were
to allow that Nature, for once, was almost
good enough for you. I am so glad it is
always good enough for me; it gives one's
critical faculty such a rest."</p>

<p>"Or proves the non-existence of one,"
added Paul.</p>

<p>"It is surprising," she continued in the
same tone, "how you always manage to spoil
the light side of life by treating it seriously.
Do you ever allow yourself a happy, irresponsible
moment?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps I haven't seen as much of the
light side as you have," he returned, quite
unmoved. "And it is always easier to play
our tragedy than our comedy; the <i>mise en scène</i>
is better adapted to begin with. That is why
the mediocre writer generally ends his book
badly; he gets his effect much more easily
than by ending it well."</p>

<p>"What has made you so cynical, I wonder?"
she asked lazily.</p>

<p>"Principally, the happiness of the vulgar,"
returned Paul promptly. "It is not our own
unhappiness that makes us cynical, but the
badly done happiness of others. Quite an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">403</a></span>
ordinary person may be able to bear misfortune
more or less nobly, but it takes a dash of
genius to be happy without being aggressive
over it."</p>

<p>"I can't imagine your taking the trouble to
be aggressive over anything," observed Katharine.
"That is probably why you prefer to
remain sombre, whether the occasion demands
it or not. It is very prosaic to have to
acknowledge that a man's most characteristic
pose is merely due to his laziness. On the
whole, I am rather glad I am quite an ordinary
person; I would much sooner be happy, even
if it does make me vulgar."</p>

<p>"Happiness is like wine," said Paul, without
heeding her. "It demoralises you at the
time, and it leaves you flat afterwards. The
most difficult thing in life is to know how to
take our happiness when it comes."</p>

<p>"It is more difficult," murmured Katharine,
"to know how to do without it when it
doesn't come."</p>

<p>They landed at St. Cloud, and walked up
through the little village and into the park
where the ruins of the palace were. They had
strayed away from their fellow passengers by
this time, and the complete solitude of the
place and its atmosphere of decay affected them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">404</a></span>
both in the same way, and they gradually
dropped into silence. He was the first to
break the pause.</p>

<p>"Don't you think it is time we brought this
farce to an end?" he asked with a carelessness
of manner that was obviously assumed.</p>

<p>"Who is being farcical?" she returned just
as lightly.</p>

<p>"You did that admirably, but it hasn't
deceived me," said Paul serenely. "You
know as well as I do that it is futile to go on
any longer like this. We have tried it for a
year, and I for one don't think very much of
it. Your experiences have doubtless been
happier than mine; but if you mean to tell me
that they have taught you to prefer solitude to
companionship, then you are as thorough a
prig as you came over here to become. And
that I don't believe for a moment, for at your
worst you were always inconsistent, and inconsistency
is the saving grace of the prig."</p>

<p>"I appreciate the honour of your approval,"
replied Katharine with exaggerated solemnity;
"but, for all that, I still think that living with
unsophistication in short petticoats is likely to
be less tiring, on the whole, than living with
some one for whom nothing in heaven or
earth has yet been brought to perfection."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">405</a></span></p>

<p>She ended with a peal of laughter. Paul
strolled on at the same measured pace as
before.</p>

<p>"Besides," she added, "I thought we had
both done with the matter a year ago. What
is the use of dragging it up again?"</p>

<p>"I thought," added Paul, "that we had also
done with taking ourselves seriously, a year
ago. But you seem to wish the process to be
renewed. Very well, then; let us begin at the
beginning. The initial difficulty, if I remember
rightly, was the fact that we were very
much in love with each other."</p>

<p>"I know <i>I</i> wasn't," said Katharine hotly.
"I never hated any one so much in my life,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Which gets over the initial difficulty,
does it not? Secondly then, you determined
in the most unselfish manner possible that
a wife would inevitably cripple what you
were kind enough to call my career. I need
hardly say how touched I felt by your charming
consideration, but I should like to point
out&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is perfectly detestable of you to have
come all this way on purpose to laugh at
me," cried Katharine.</p>

<p>"I should like to point out," repeated Paul,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">406</a></span>
"that I feel quite capable of pursuing my
career without any suggestions from my wife at
all, and that, engrossing as her presence would
undoubtedly prove&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It seems to me," interrupted Katharine,
"that you don't want a wife at all; you only
want an audience."</p>

<p>"I don't think," said Paul, smiling indulgently,
"that we need quarrel about terms,
need we? Well, as I was saying, my career
would probably continue to take care of itself,
even if there were two of us to be asked out to
dinner, instead of one. And that disposes of
the second obstacle, doesn't it? The third
and last&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Last? There are millions of others!"</p>

<p>"The third and last," resumed Paul, "was,
I think, the trifling fact that I had once presumed
to call you a prig, in consequence of
which you chose to pretend you were afraid of
me. Wasn't that so?"</p>

<p>"Afraid of you? What a ridiculous idea!"
she exclaimed. "Why, I was never afraid of
you in my life!"</p>

<p>"Which disposes of the third and last difficulty,"
said Paul promptly.</p>

<p>Katharine stamped her foot and walked on
in front of him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">407</a></span></p>

<p>"You don't seem to think," she said, "that
I might not <i>want</i> to marry you."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said Paul; "I don't."</p>

<p>She said no more, but continued to walk a
little way in front of him so that he could not
see her face. She only spoke once again on
their way down to the boat.</p>

<p>"How was Ted looking when you saw
him?" she asked abruptly. "Perhaps you
didn't notice, though?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said Paul, blandly. "I've never
seen him looking better; he seemed to have
had a splendid time out there. He asked after
you, by the way, and seemed rather surprised
that I hadn't heard from you."</p>

<p>She made no comment, and they reached
the boat in silence.</p>

<p>"You will come back to tea with me?" she
said, as they stood waiting for it to start.</p>

<p>"With you,&mdash;or with unsophistication?"</p>

<p>"Oh, with me of course! Don't you
think you have been funny enough for one
afternoon?"</p>

<p>"Our best jokes are always our unconscious
ones," murmured Paul. "Seriously,
though, I think I won't bother you any more.
I shall only be in the way if I stay any longer."</p>

<p>"Now what have I done," she demanded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">408</a></span>
indignantly, "to make you think you are in
the way?"</p>

<p>"Oh, of course&mdash;nothing. So foolish of
me!" said Paul humbly. "I shall be delighted
to return with you; there are still so
many things we want to say to each other,
are there not?"</p>

<p>However, they did not say them on the way
home, for Katharine soon became thoughtful
again, and he made no further attempt to
draw her out but remained studiously at the
other end of the boat until they landed; and
after that, the noise of the cab in which they
drove across Paris was sufficient excuse for
refraining from anything like conversation.
At the top of the stairs, as they stayed for a
moment outside her <i>appartement</i> to recover their
breath, she suddenly turned to him with one
of her unaccountable smiles.</p>

<p>"Well?" he said.</p>

<p>"You know I didn't mean to be cross, don't
you?" she asked him in a hurried undertone.</p>

<p>"You absurd little silly!" was all he said.</p>

<p>They sat for a long time over tea, and
neither of them felt inclined to talk. But the
silence was not embarrassing. And the early
spring day drew to a close and the room grew
dark with shadows; and still they sat there,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">409</a></span>
and it did not occur to either of them to
make conversation. At last, Katharine stirred
in her seat at the end of the sofa and looked
towards the dim outline of his figure against
the window, and finished her reflections out
loud.</p>

<p>"After all," she said thoughtfully, "the
great thing is to be sane. Nothing else matters
much if one can only be sane about things.
There are heaps of reasons why you and I
should not marry, if we were to begin hunting
them up; but why bother about it? You
know and I know that we have simply got
to try the experiment, and chance the rest.
One must risk something. And it can't be
much worse than going on alone like this."</p>

<p>"No," said Paul, "it can't be worse than
that."</p>

<p>He came and sat on the sofa, too, and there
was silence once more. He put out his hand
to find hers, and she gave it him and laughed
softly.</p>

<p>"I have an idea," she said irrelevantly.
"We must marry Ted to Marion."</p>

<p>"We?" said Paul, smiling. And she
laughed again.</p>

<p>"Isn't it ridiculous," she said, "after all
our views about marriage and so on,&mdash;to end
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">410</a></span>
in behaving just like any one else who never
had any views at all?"</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Paul. "We haven't even
stuck to our priggishness."</p>

<p>"<i>We?</i>" exclaimed Katharine.</p>

<p>But there is always a limit to a man's confessions,
and Paul's was never finished.</p>

<p class="center"><i>AT THE RELTON ARMS.</i></p>

<p>Miss Evelyn Sharp is to be congratulated on having, through the mouth
of one of her characters, said one of the wisest words yet spoken on what
is rather absurdly called "The Marriage Question" (page 132). It is an
interesting and well-written story, with some smart characterisation and
quite a sufficiency of humour.&mdash;<i>Daily Chronicle.</i></p>

<p>A delightful story. The most genuine piece of humour in a book that
is nowhere devoid of it, is that scene in the inn parlour where Digby finds
himself engaged to two young women within five minutes; while the two
brief colloquies of the landlady and her cronies make one suspect that the
author could produce an admirable study of village humour.&mdash;<i>Athenæum.</i></p>

<p>A distinctly clever book, of a fresh conventionality.&mdash;<i>Academy.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>With 8 coloured Illustrations and decorated cover by

<p>Of the stories it is impossible to speak too highly; they are true fairy
literature, and the most exigent taste will be satisfied with them.&mdash;<i>Truth

marvellous pictures, excelling even the cover, the volume must take a
literally blazing place on a child's book-shelf. "Wymps" has other attractions,&mdash;six,
<i>original</i> fairy stories. Now, originality is a rare thing in fairy
stories, so that altogether we find the book unique.&mdash;<i>Literary
